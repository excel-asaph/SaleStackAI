[h1]WHAT IS IT?
[p]What if you and your team had the skills to write copy that would consistently crush conversions … even from cold traffic?
[p]Now, imagine how quickly you could scale your business, and your client’s businesses, if every ad, every sales page, every message was compliant with Facebook, Google, Instagram, LinkedIn, YouTube and any other online media platform you choose to advertise with … the first time it is submitted for review.
[p]That’s what is possible when you have a team of
[em]High Income Copywriters
[h1]WHY IS THIS RELEVANT?
[p]Every business wants more customers, correct? Customers are the lifeblood of a business. But it is getting harder and harder to attract and convert new customers online.
[p]Not only from rising ad costs, increased competition, and the decline in organic social media reach …
[p]But also because … copywriting has changed.
[p]The traditional copywriting methods which have been used for decades worked great for print ads and sales pages in the early years of online marketing.
[p]Long copy, bold claims, crazy promises … and in no uncertain terms … telling the reader what to do and what they will achieve.
[p]This is the
[strong]Old Copywriting Model
[strong]But here is the problem.
[p]The Social Media and Search Engine giants that control the advertising space online don’t like the
[strong]Old Copywriting Model
[p]They restrict what you can say, how you say it and the claims and promises you can make. Failure to abide by their rules can result in your account being suspended or worse, shut down.
[p]Copywriters and business owners who persist in following the
[strong]Old Copywriting Model
[p]In short … The
[strong]Old Copywriting Model
[p]To be successful, your team must develop the skills of the
[strong]New Copywriting Model
[em]High Income Copywriter™
[p]You see human psychology and the way people make a buying decision hasn’t changed, but the way the copy is consumed has changed.
[p]As a
[em]High Ticket Copywriter™
[p]This is a very valuable skill to have and is in high demand from a seemingly endless number of businesses on the internet.
[p]Imagine the possibilities for your business if your entire team were Certified

[p]But I’m not done yet. When you enroll in the High Income Copywriter™ Certification Program, you will also receive these 9 fantastic free gifts valued at over
[strong]$9,300
[em]High Income Copywriter™
[span]Bonus Gift #1
[p]I’ve built up a collection of proven ads and sales letters that have generated over $250 million in sales. So anytime you want to write a new sales message, you can take what’s working from this swipe file and tweak it.
[span]Bonus Gift #2
[p]You’ll get 11 breakdowns of the most profitable ads and emails from some of the world’s most successful product launches. These have generated over $10 million in days, and you can use the same strategies they used behind it.
[span]Bonus Gift #3
[p]When you need a headline, don’t try to stare at a blank screen. What if I could give you 300 headline templates instead? All you need to do is fill in the blank, and you’ve got a proven headline ready to go.
[span]Bonus Gift #4
[p]It doesn’t matter how good your email is if people delete it and never read it. That’s why I’ve put together a massive list of some of the best subject lines I could find from all industries.
[span]Bonus Gift #5
[p]My team and I spent thousands of hours testing and tweaking to make sure our ads get approved. This took us from getting 90% disapproved to 99% approved. So when you write something for your business or agencies, you could just quickly run through this checklist and not worry about having the ads account disapproved, or worse yet, shut down.
[span]Bonus Gift #6
[p]This “checklist” is like having one of the best copywriters in the world look over your shoulders to critique your copy, correct any mistakes you have, and help you skyrocket the pulling power of your marketing piece.
[p]I originally wrote this checklist for myself when I was running my one-man copywriting agency. I used it to produce over $15 million in revenue for my clients, and now you can too.
[span]Bonus Gift #7
[p]You can use this collection of the most impactful power words to grab and hold people’s attention when you want it.
[span]Bonus Gift #8
[p]When I was learning from my mentor Alan, he wouldn’t write a sales letter if he didn’t think he would make a million dollars. Now I have one of the very few and rare collections of his letters in the world. So I’m going to give you his best 10 sales letters from my collection.

[p]I'm a student for over 2 years now.
[br]Have done HTC before which have changed my life.
[br]HIC is a great value for money.
[br]I'm only half way through and I have already started to understand the structure of a copy.
[br]First off all it helps you change your mind set which is probably the thing we have to work harder  at the beginning.
[br]Learning takes time and efforts which I could never imagine before I started.
[br]The good thing is that we have to copy the masters for the first few years before we can create our own style.
[br]And sifu Dan have given plenty of material to copy.
[br]Thank you again sifu Dan and his team for all the support.
[br]Have done courses before with other mentors  but I find the support team  better then the others.
[br]They will be next to you anytime you need.
[br]Most off the time acting proactive.
[br]Thank you

[b]Become the person I can be
[p]For a long time I use to think my only why was to help my family and get a new job, but recently IÕve dug deep and found out my true whyÉ
[br]That is to be the person not only I thought or think I could be but what others know I could be as well.
[br]IÕve always thought that I was suppose to do more then most in my family, but seemed to fall just shortÉ
[br]After reading ÒThink and Grow RichÓ I found out what has happened. I fail then quit, that was it but I found that with copywriting and from Sifu all failure is is feedback and that as changed my life.
[br]Now I take all the feedback and use it to better myself and become the person I know I can and others know I should be.

[b]Don't give up. Copy and HIC are powerful
[p]3 years ago I enrolled in HIC. Yesterday I hit my first $10K month.
[br]Sifu Dan Lok, I will always be grateful to you and this community. My wife and I did 8 trips around Europe this year alone, and live in one of the fanciest neighborhoods in Lisbon (Portugal), because of Copywriting alone (6 months ago I told her to retire and focus on her passion, photography).
[br]3 years ago I literally couldn't pay for groceries, was living in a 'Gotham-like' city in Colombia, and had $40k in debt.
[br]I don't say this to impress you, but to impress upon you that... Copy and HIC are powerful. Don't give up!!

[b]Copywriting saves lives!
[p]I just received the news that one video I created for an NGO (using copywriting principles) got them a $35,000 grant. This money will allow them to renew the equipment of an old hospital in the country side of Colombia - and save hundreds of lives
[br]Here are 3 things I did:
[br]1- Used storytelling to connect emotionally FIRST before trying to pitch anything.
[br]2- Focused on ONE character - a male peasant who was hit by a car, because the cities are SO overpopulated that they are invading the country side
[br]3- I introduced data from authority sources to show the magnitude of the problem, and to answer "what's in it for you". Most grantmakers are looking for contribution, so I showed them the huge impact this project was going to have in real families with real faces.
[br]Dan Lok Your mentorship keeps saving lives. You have no idea the ripple effect of your work, on millions of lives around the globe... many of which don't even know you.
[br]Thanks Sifu .This is one of those moments that make ALL the learning and effort in learning the copywriting skill worth it.
