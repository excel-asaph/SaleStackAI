[u]Funnel #1 - The 3-Way Call Funnel
[u]Create the perfect communication “bridge” between YOU and your prospect!

[div]just another “how to” book on Internet Marketing.
[div]It is
[u]NOT
[div]just about expanding outside your current web of contacts - yet these secrets will help you to get MORE super-interested leads than you’ve ever experienced before.
[span]It is
[u]NOT
[span]just about turning those leads into promoters on your team - yet these secrets will allow you to share your message (and your business opportunity) more easily.
[div]Network Marketing Secrets is
[b]A SHORTCUT.
[div]Not enough of the RIGHT leads is a symptom of a much greater problem.
[div]Chances are, you’ve either tapped out your current network, or you aren’t building your team as quickly as you want.
[b]The GOOD news is that it is simple to fix…

[b]“Can I use sales funnels to grow my company?”
[div]I always smile at this question, because literally 99% of
[b]ALL networking companies
[div]were built using the SAME 3 FUNNELS…. (offline funnels).
[div]Yet for some crazy reason when people come online, they completely forget how these 3 funnels have worked for them and all of the leaders in their companies.
[div]Instead they jump online and try out whatever fad is new and exciting at the time, and completely forget the
[b]CORE STRATEGY
[div], the core
[b]FUNNELS
[div]that have made them successful up to that point.
[div]This article will take you behind the scenes of the three funnels that have built 99% of ALL successful network marketing companies, and show you how to replicate them online with simple sales funnels. You’ll be able to plug your network marketing opportunity into these funnels within just a few minutes.
[div]I’ll also tell you the one step that everyone forgets. Miss this step and your funnels will never gain the momentum you need to be a top earner.

[li]Why your company’s website is accidentally causing your customers to
[b]RUN
[b]AWAY
[li]before they ever sign up (kinda like a really bad date)...it’s not your company’s fault - after all, they are experts in their products, not in CONVERTING visitors to customers. Pg. 11

[span]Oh, and in case you're wondering...
[b]There Is No Catch!
[div]I’ve seen plenty of websites out there that offer you something awesome for free...only to trap you into some program that charges your card every month.
[b]This isn't one of them.
[div]If you know me at all, you know that’s simply not my style.
[div]There's
[b]NO hidden "continuity program"...
[b]NO programs that you accidentally enter into and then can’t ever get out of…
[div](I hate those)
[b]No 3rd-party partners
[div]that you don’t realize you’re signing up to…(I hate those even more)
[b]But there
[u]ARE
[b]are few reasons why I'm doing this:
[b]1. It’s my way of saying thank you
[div]for being a dedicated subscriber. The network marketing world has made me a LOT of money, and this is kind of a cool way to give back in my own meaningful way.
[div]2. Because I make most of my money in several other businesses (I run real businesses online selling supplements, physical products software, and more)...
[b]it doesn't hurt me to share with you my very best stuff.
[div]3.
[b]I get another one of my products in your hands!
[div]When it helps you, and you see how awesome and powerful it is for your business, it just might get you thinking about checking out some of my other stuff in the future….
[div]4. It is one of my fundamental beliefs that when we reach a certain point of success in business (or in life), in order to continue GROWING,
[b]the student must become the teacher,
[span]and help others who are on the same journey.
