[h2]A little Back-story
[p]I used to refill my LPG gas cylinder every week.. I spent nothing less than N20k monthly on cooking gas alone, this is a whole monthly salary for some people in Nigeria.
[p]At a point, i thought this spending was really outrageous and so i decided to seek other alternatives for my cooking.
[p]First.. I tried using electric stoves, I realized this doubled my monthly electricity bills and it didn’t make sense as I was trying to curtail my expenses, and this meant me jumping from frying pan to fire.
[p]Going back to Kerosene stove was out of the question, because it didn’t meet my heating standards, and will only blacken my pots. Not to mention the fact that Kerosene has also skyrocketed in price.
[h5]In my quest for a cheaper solution to cooking,I discovered an all in one package:
[strong]Biogas!
[strong]I wanted something that meets the same standards as LPG gas, but less expensive.
[strong]I ended up having something that surpasses that standard and also
[span]entirely Free!!
[h2]Biogas user reviews
[h2]Yes, Biogas is a free cooking gas!!
[h4]How?!
[div]I do not buy Biogas
[div]I generate Biogas at home!
[h4]How?!
[div]I simply recycle my Wastes to Biogas?
[h4]Where?!
[div]Right in my backyard, I make my own cooking gas by recycling my wastes!
[h4]Is that not risky?!
[div]Not at all!! Biogas is even much safer to handle than LPG gas… Unlike LPG, Biogas offers no risk of explosion!!
[h4]What kind of wastes form the gas?
[div]All kinds of Organic wastes!
[div]Kitchen wastes, soured food, leftover food, bad fruits & Vegetables, animal wastes, unwanted plants etc.
[h4]How do I recycle these wastes to cooking gas?
[div]With the help of a biogas waste recycling plant!
[h4]Did I purchase this recycling plant from somewhere?
[div]Absolutely not! I built it all by myself,  it required only a plastic container (tank or drum) and a few plumbing materials to put this together!
[h4]How can you Learn?
[strong]Our DIY biogas training course is an online self-paced, video training that detailed the processes of biogas technology, the training is very practical,   we literally video-taped the whole fabrication process of our biogas plant and pieced the knowledge in such a way that a child can even reproduce the plant given the materials and equipment needed. We also detailed the feeding processes, safety and maintenance of a biogas plant etc. It’s a well packed training for anyone interested in having the knowledge at their finger tips and starting their own biogas plant for domestic or business purposes.
[h3]Still not convinced??
[strong]Watch me recycle my kitchen wastes into cooking gas, double tap  on the video below:
[h2]WAIT! DO NOT ASSUME THIS DOESN'T CONCERN YOU
[h2]you  can actally earn in 6 figures installing biogas plant for clients!!
[h2]The market is still relatively virgin in Nigeria and in many African countries and this provides a very big market opportunity for individuals who will decide to leverage on the idea of biogas technology whether by becoming biogas plant installers or setting up commercial biogas plant facilities to meet energy demands.
