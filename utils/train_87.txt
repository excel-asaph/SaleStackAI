[h1]6 Questions Every Knowledge Worker, Creator And Life-Long Learner Must Answer
[strong]1. Are you constantly wasting time
[p]looking for information you were
[em]sure
[p]you had saved?
[strong]‍
[p]‍
[strong]2. Is that pile of unfinished projects
[p]causing shame and anxiety?
[strong]‍
[strong]3. Are you stuck in a perpetual state of overwhelm
[p]when you look at your buzzing social media feed, your email inbox at 999+ unread messages, and the 17 open browser tabs with interesting articles to read?
[p]‍
[strong]4. Are you trying to get into a flow state
[p], but when you sit down to work, you feel overwhelmed and unsure where to start?
[strong]5. Are you easily distracted by the next meeting/to-do/emergency
[p]instead of being fully present with your loved ones?
[strong]‍
[strong]6. Are you always busy
[p]and yet don’t feel like you’re moving your life forward in the areas that matter most to you?
[p]If you answered “no” to all of these questions, great! You can close this page.
[p]But if you nodded your head at least once and
[span]want to finally clear the mental clutter and start doing your best work with clarity, purpose, and ease…
[p]Then read on!
[h2]Hi, I’m Tiago Forte
[p]AUTHOR & CREATOR OF BUILDING A SECOND BRAIN
[p]I’ve spent more than 10 years researching and personally experimenting with
[span]a new way of organizing our digital lives and improving our productivity
[p].
[p]What started as a quest to deal with a chronic illness turned into
[span]a life-long mission to help you harness the full potential of your ideas
[p]and turn them into reality.
[p]My work has been featured in
[p]If you’re reading this, then something in your life has caused you to stop and think,
[h2]“There must be a better way!”
[p](just like my mysterious illness did for me).
[strong]Maybe your responsibilities have increased dramatically
[p]as you started a family, a new job, or a business, and now you need a way to do great work, despite having less time.
[strong]You might feel like you’re dropping balls left, right, and center
[p], losing track of open threads, and it’s impacting those around you.
[strong]Maybe you’re dissatisfied with your current job
[p]and want to move to a more fulfilling career and get more out of life.
[strong]Or maybe you have a lot of ideas and expertise
[p]but don’t know how to link all that information together to make the impact you want to make.
[p]Whatever your situation, I can tell you that you’re not alone.
[h2]Why is it normal for us to feel scattered, overworked, and overwhelmed all the time?
[p]When I ask people why they aren’t going after their goals (and instead often lower their hopes and ambitions instead), the #1 answer is always:
[strong]Information overload!
[p]They share things like…
[p]‍
[em]“I get overwhelmed at the tasks before me. I don’t know how to manage the volume and set priorities.”
[em]“Things just fall through the cracks.”
[em]“I just feel like I can’t make progress on anything.”
[p]This state of permanent information overload and overwhelm has become our “new normal.”
[p]Why? Because
[strong]our biological brains are reaching their capacity
[p]. We have way too much to remember, too much to think about, and too much to do.
[p]And the problem is: The volume of information flooding our brains today is just a trickle compared to what’s coming.
[p](Forecasts
[a]*
[p]show that the volume of information created, captured, and consumed worldwide will
[em]double
[p]from 2022 to 2025. Isn’t that crazy?)
[p]That brings us to the key question…
[h2]How can we achieve our goals when our brains are already maxed out?
[p]The answer is to build a “Second Brain.”
[p]Now, you’re probably wondering: “What the heck is that?”
[p]A "Second Brain" is simply the name for a
[strong]trusted place outside your head where you can collect and organize your most important ideas and insights
[p](while filtering out the junk) and use them to do your best work.
[p]We already have thousands of people all over the world using their Second Brains to:
[strong]Combat information overwhelm
[li]and free up their attention for more creative, interesting endeavors.
[strong]Keep the most important information just two clicks away,
[li]giving them peace of mind that their knowledge and insights are safely stored and available whenever they need them.
[strong]Create a playground of their own thoughts, ideas, resources, and connections
[li]to bring to life the creative works that have been locked up inside.
[strong]Know exactly where to start when they sit down to work
[li], so they can achieve lift-off on long-awaited projects and take them to the finish line.
[strong]‍
[strong]Finally focus their time and energy
[li]on the people and things that are most important to them.
[h2]So, what exactly is a Second Brain?
[p]A minute ago, I told you it's a place for storing your ideas and information. And while your Second Brain is indeed a place, it's more than that.
[strong]It’s a system you follow.
[p]Think of it as an operating system, like Windows or iOS. Except for your life and work.
[p]The Second Brainers (as we call ourselves) use this system daily.
[p]Every time they come across a new piece of useful information, it enters their system. And when they begin a new project at work or at home, the tasks flow from their system.
[p]Of course, we have a name for that, too. It’s called CODE.
[p]CODE is our proven process for
[strong]consistently turning the information you consume into creative output and concrete results.
[sub]C
[h2]apture only the most important information
[p]Remember how we talked about being bombarded with information? This is your first line of defense.
[p]Whether you’re collecting information from meetings, books, articles, podcasts, or conversations…you’ll escape the “reactivity loop,” consume content at your own pace, and capture what resonates with
[em]you
[p].
[p]That way, you can let everything else (and the FOMO) go. This filtering process alone will free up 50% more head space.
[sub]O
[h2]rganize for actionability
[p]You’re capturing information, but where do you put everything? How do you organize your digital life?
[p]From now on: No more random notes spread across your different apps, docs, notepads, and sticky notes. Not only will you know where your insights are, but you’ll also organize your digital life differently than ever before — for action.
[p]This will make it easy to prioritize your life and turn your digital notes into “thinking tools” that allow you to access brain power you didn’t even know you had.
[sub]D
[h2]istill down to the essence
[p]This is where the magic happens. The Distill phase is how you're able to find what you need at a moment's notice.
[p]In the midst of a busy workday, you don’t have time to review ten pages of notes on a book you read last year. By distilling your notes in a way that your future self can use them over and over again, you’ll build your own “knowledge treasury” full of your unique intellectual property.
[sub]E
[h2]xpress your unique ideas and experiences
[p]Now it’s time for action. All the previous steps—capturing, organizing, and distilling—are geared toward one ultimate purpose: Getting your work done faster with less effort. And thanks to your Second Brain, you’ll never start from a blank page again.
[p]With the building blocks all laid out, you can start expressing your ideas in your unique voice –through writing, speaking, designing, teaching, persuading, or building a product or a business – to help advance your career and make a meaningful contribution to the world.
[p]CODE is the result of thousands of hours spent teaching, speaking, coaching, and writing about productivity and Personal Knowledge Management.
[p]I’ve charged between $25,000 and $50,000 to teach this system to elite professionals at some of the world’s leading organizations, such as…
[p]But I want to make that same quality of education available to everyone, regardless of where they live or which resources they have access to.
[h2]Living by the CODE system will supercharge your career, business, and life
[p]You don’t have to take our word for it. Here’s what graduates of our Building a Second Brain program say…
[em]BASB has
[em]literally changed my life.
[em]Every time I take this course I get a new job that's more specialized and better aligned with my goals and beliefs.
[p]Camila Holanda
[p]Designer, Researcher & Futurist
[em]After taking BASB,
[em]I feel 1000X more productive
[em]and have a system that gets a lot done for me.
[p]Yaw Owusu-Ansah
[p]WordPress Developer
[em]After BASB, my thoughts are clearer and my writing has improved. It's already allowed me to
[em]create things I never would have considered before
[em]this course.
[p]Tamisha O'Neal
[p]Board-certified Cosmetologist
[em]The BASB course has made me
[em]more confident in handling what life throws at me
[em]and being more effective in expressing myself.
[p]Dennis Nehrenheim
[p]Software Engineer & Blogger
[em]BASB has
[em]reduced my stress levels
[em]. I now feel less scattered and more directed.
[p]Sheila Glesmann
[p]Owner of Emission Strategies, Inc.
[em]I feel as though I have
[em]increased my IQ by 20 points
[em]. Of course this isn't true, but it feels this way because I am thinking so much more clearly and with so much more relaxation and concentration.

[p]Fractional CFO
[h2]Now, how do you get started?
[strong]This isn’t about finding the “perfect” productivity app to solve all your problems.
[p]It doesn’t exist!
[p]Too many people get lost in the sea of tools available out there.
[p](As one of our students exclaimed:
[em]“I have all the tools and none of the results!”)
[strong]Nor is it about mastering every feature of the most sophisticated software program available.
[p]While tinkering may
[em]feel
[p]like learning, it’s likely only a distraction from what really matters: moving your goals forward. These apps ultimately have to serve you, not the other way around.
[strong]And watching more YouTube videos or reading another book on productivity won’t help either.
[p]You’re still left alone, trying to apply what you’ve learned to your situation.
[p]After teaching 5,000 students from around the world, I’ve found that…
[strong]The best way to get started is by putting CODE to use and applying it to your current projects and priorities.
[p]It doesn’t matter if…
[li]You’re not naturally “organized” (You don’t have to be. Organizing your knowledge should help you progress toward your goals, rather than turning you into a notetaking specialist)
[li]You’re already tapped out for time and energy (A Second Brain will help you do more with less and actually
[em]save
[li]you time and energy)
[li]You have limits on what hardware or software you can use (This system works across any platform)
[p]You make progress by taking action.
[strong]That’s how you’ll see immediate results.
[p]And we’ve created the perfect place for you to do just that.

[h1]Yet another “expensive self-help program”?
[p]Look, at this point, you might be suspicious that Building a Second Brain is just yet another self-help program, promising the moon with productivity tips, life hacks, and “one weird trick.”
[p]I get it.
[p]There are far too many feel-good, wishy-washy “secret systems” cooked up by people looking to make a quick buck.
[p]So I want to address any doubts in your mind head on
[h2]There are 7 critical differences between Building a Second Brain and so many other courses and programs out there
[div]1. Building a Second Brain isn’t abstract and theoretical
[p]This system was developed in the trenches of dealing with real-life problems, not in a laboratory or classroom, which means it is highly practical and immediately useful.
[p]While we focus on practical skills, we don’t stop there: The course also cultivates the deeper mindset and paradigm shifts necessary to thrive in an age of information abundance.
[div]2. Building a Second Brain isn’t a random collection of disconnected “tips and tricks”
[p]This system was developed in the trenches of dealing with real-life problems, not in a laboratory or classroom, which means it is highly practical and immediately useful.
[p]While we focus on practical skills, we don’t stop there: The course also cultivates the deeper mindset and paradigm shifts necessary to thrive in an age of information abundance.
[p]‍
[p]It’s based on how the fundamental creative process works (and has worked for thousands of years):
[p]‍
[li]‍
[strong]Capturing
[li]information from the outside world
[li]‍
[strong]Organizing
[li]it in a way that lets you easily find and use it
[strong]‍
[strong]Distilling
[li]it down to the best ideas
[li]‍
[strong]Expressing
[li]your ideas in your unique voice through writing, speaking, designing, or teaching
[p]This is what we call the
[strong]CODE method
[p]– our 4-step process for consistently turning the information you consume into creative output and concrete results.
[div]3. Building a Second Brain doesn’t require you to work even harder and do even more
[p]Organizing information for the sake of it isn’t the goal of a Second Brain. We teach you how to do more with less, to use the sources of leverage available to you, and to offload as much effort as possible to technology. As a result, you get more time and freedom to pursue the things that are important to you.
[div]4. Building a Second Brain isn’t about optimizing or perfecting yourself
[p]This is actually the opposite of self-improvement. Building a Second Brain is about optimizing a
[em]system outside of yourself
[p]– a system not subject to your limitations and constraints. It’s designed to leave you happily unoptimized, free to roam, to wonder, to
[em]wander
[p]toward whatever makes you feel alive here and now in each moment.
[div]5. Building a Second Brain isn’t fixated on any particular app or software
[p]Building a Second Brain is tool-agnostic, meaning it works with any app or platform you prefer to use. In our community, students use Evernote, Notion, Apple Notes, OneNote, Craft, Roam, Obsidian, Bear, Google Keep, among many other notetaking tools.
[div]6. Building a Second Brain doesn’t require any pre-existing knowledge or skills
[p]Building a Second Brain only requires you to have the most basic familiarity with how to use a computer or smartphone. And because we’ve noticed that so many people begin the course without knowing which notetaking app to use, we’ll guide you through choosing one before the first live session.
[div]7. Building a Second Brain isn’t a “take it or leave it” ideology where you must accept all or nothing
[p]Applying even one or two of the methods I teach can revolutionize your productivity and learning. And if any part doesn’t make sense or doesn’t resonate with you, put it aside. You can mix and match the tools and techniques you learn to suit your needs.

[h2]A final word from Tiago
[p]Imagine what it would be like if you knew with total certainty that every great idea you encountered was reliably saved forever.
[p]That you could wave goodbye to information overload because you have a way to filter out the junk while saving only the best stuff.
[p]You could move forward decisively on your goals without wondering whether you had all the right information. You could execute your projects and create new things without wondering whether this was really the best you could do.
[p]If you're paid to think for a living, you cannot afford not to invest in the most valuable asset you own – your ideas.
[p]You can’t afford to burden your biological brain with trivial details that only gunk up your wheels as you go about your workday and go after your goals.
[p]It’s time to build a Second Brain and fully unlock the potential you know you are capable of.
[p]Don't spend 10 years figuring out how to make your knowledge work for you like I did. Don't resign yourself to watching your ideas pile up and never doing anything with them. Don't reach the end of your career wondering if you were actually capable of more.
[p]Join me on this incredible journey, and find out what it's really like to have the full power of a Second Brain at your fingertips.
[p]See you inside!
