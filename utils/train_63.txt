[div]What Is
[b]Platform Closing?
[i]Platform Closing is the ability to go on any platform; whether it's through a sales video, webinar, or live event to present in a way that's unforgettable, have your audience hanging on your every word, and get them wanting to invest in whatever it is that you have to offer by the end of that presentation.
[i]This is a highly specialized skill that many marketers, speakers, and trainers have been unable to figure out.
[i]To be clear, this book is not about speaking or presenting confidently. You can properly learn how to do that for free in Toastmasters. There is a huge difference between public speaking and actually closing and converting your audience into paying customers.
[b]What If Your Message Has The Ability To Change Someone's Life?
[div]What if it could help to change someone's health, repair their marriage, or grow their business?
[div]You can only sustain that message if you knew how to sell, inspire and monetize from that expertise.
[li]​Platform Closing will help you to
[b]find your voice
[li]and give you clarity on how to monetize that message.
[li]​Platform Closing will show you how to
[b]share your message
[li]and close without being sleazy, pushy, or manipulative.
[li]​Platform Closing will teach you how to
[u]position your offer
[li]through sales videos, webinars, or live events.
[b]Hurry, This FREE Offer Won't Last Long!
[b]Most Speakers, Marketers, and Entrepreneurs Just Aren’t Aware Of These Cutting Edge Strategies…
[div]I remember the first time I ever did a presentation.
[div]For many years I have been marketing online and I thought doing a presentation was pretty much the same thing.
[div]I thought to myself "
[i]As long as I provide great content and value, the audience will be able to make that informed decision and invest in what it is that I have to offer.
[div]"
[div]Pretty straightforward, right?
[div]When it was time to make the offer, and I asked them to go to the back tables to invest, nobody moved.
[div]I bombed... hard.
[div]It was weird. It was awkward. It was embarrassing.
[div]It was in this huge expo hall with 900 people and back then things were very different. There was no music, nothing.
[div]I had to walk to the back of the room and it was like the walk of shame. That walk felt like it took forever.
[div]The funny thing was... I had so many people coming up to me after telling me how great the content was and how inspired they were but nobody bought anything!
[div]That was when I realized that
[b]speaking and selling are 2 completely different skills
[div].
[div]As I continued the journey of practicing and learning from the best of the best, I got better.
[div]From totally sucking initially, I sucked less and less. And eventually, I realized hey... I'm pretty good at this!
[div]Now, after years of practicing… years of speaking on hundreds of stages, I’ve discovered some of the most effective, and little-known strategies to make million-dollar presentations.
[div]I've now been able to speak in over 20++ countries in the world's largest stages and have been blessed to have shared the stage and worked with people like Richard Branson, Tony Robbins, Robert Kiyosaki, and other legends in the industry.
[div]If there's one thing I've learned in this journey, is that speaking and closing (both online and offline) is a
[i]learnable, trainable
[div]skill.
[div]If you've ever wanted to discover how to present in a way that's unforgettable, have your audience hanging on your every word, and have them invest in whatever it is that you have to offer at the end, then this book is for you.
[div]This book will reveal the same strategies that have generated me well over $10MM++ through
[b]sales videos, webinars, and live events
[div]... and how you can do it too.

[b]Don't Take My Word For It, Here's What Others Have To Say...
[div]"After training with Peng Joon, I have learned how to monetise my brand, I have greater clarity on what direction I'm heading, and my business has been transformed and multiplied because of Peng Joon."
[b]– Julius Dein
[div]“If you’re looking to do events, drive traffic, sell products, I highly recommend working with Peng Joon”
[b]– Russell Brunson
[div]“Not only myself but I had my director of events go through Peng Joon’s system. I don’t recommend a lot of people but this system, I highly recommend.”
[b]– Dan Lok
[div]“As a direct learning results learning with Peng Joon, I actually created my own online training program, The Iron Mastery and the results was overwhelming! Take it from me, he will definitely change your life.”
[b]– Jordan Yeoh
[div]“I was able to crank out a brand new webinar, start to finish, in one night. He made it so easy in a done-for-you way to follow… he gives you actual templates to follow and a video that you play and pause as you go with each slide. I was able to double my close rate in the last webinar I did with his strategy which is huge because I’ve been doing webinars for years. If you’re on the fence, the answer is YES!”
[b]– Molly Kaiser
[b]"This Is Not Theory...
[b]I've Used These Strategies in Over 20+ Countries..."
[div]What Is
[b]Platform Closing?
[div]Like I mentioned before,
[b]this book retails for $19.95 on Amazon but I've bought a copy for you!
[div]All I ask is that you help me cover the shipping and handling ($7.95 US or $14.95 international).
[div]Oh, and in case you're still wondering...
[b]It’s FREE and There Is No Catch!
[div]There are more than a handful of websites out there that offer you something valuable for free, but then they sneakily run you into a recurring program that charges your card every month.
[b]This Is Not One Of Them
[div]There is
[b]NO hidden "continuity fee"
[div]- and in case you’re wondering why I’ve decided to offer this…
[div]I’ve got a few interesting reasons…
[div]1. After years of trying to figure out what works and what doesn't in the speaking industry, this would be my way of
[b]giving back to the community...
[div]2. Unlike many "speaker trainers", there's too much stuff being peddled based on theory, stuff that sounds good on paper but isn't actually effective. I'm hoping that with this book,
[b]this changes the entire landscape
[div]of how sales videos, webinars, and live events are done.
[div]3. Hopefully with the amount of value that you get from this book,
[b]you'll want to work with me
[div]in other ways. ;)
[div]4. My last book took me 5 years to write... and I still didn't like it. This book, however,
[b]I'm very proud of it.
[div]5.
[b]I’d like as many people as possible to read it
[div]because I truly believe that the ability to present, speak, and close is the #1 skill every entrepreneur needs.
