[p]Don’t just be the

[span]PROVE it.

[p]for consulting as well, and I still have a waitlist”

[p]“The work just came flooding in!”
[p]“I signed up three new clients in August and am writing my first 2 sales pages at the same time! My clients are so happy with my work on the sales pages so far that they now both say that
[strong]they want to work with me as their copywriter for emails, launches, Facebook ads, proposals, writing their social media profiles…
[p]It took me a while to get there, but once I got those first clients and they could see what I could do, the
[span]work just came flooding in!
[p]”
[div]Naomi Dalton
[p]Freelance Copywriter
[div]Real talk: There are
[span]123 million
[div]people calling themselves copywriters on LinkedIn.
[p]Many have no idea what they’re doing so they chuck a prompt in ChatGPT and hope for the best
[em](no judgment – just facts).
[p]Others have
[em]some
[p]idea what they’re doing so they take what they can and pray the client doesn’t ask too many questions.
[p]Meanwhile, a growing number of copywriters are commanding
[em]better-than-lawyers-charge
[p]rates and now their biggest problem is what to do with all the extra leads their happy clients keep sending them.
[p]And when you see those rockstars celebrating the results from their $30K email project on socials, there’s one question you can’t shake:
[div]“What do they know that I don’t?”
[p]Bottom line → the copywriters you admire understand that if you want clients to see you as an expert and pay you accordingly…
[div]You need to become a strategic copywriter.
[span]Because knowing “how” to write a headline is one thing. But when you know the
[span]WHY
[span]behind crafting ridiculously persuasive copy, you can finally:
[strong]stop waiting around for the client to tell you what they need
[p]because you’re the one in the driver’s seat (and the client LOVES you for it)
[p]defend your copy like a MOFO because
[strong]every word on the page is rooted in scientific data and research
[p]replace panic for legitimate
[strong]excitement when your copy goes live
[p]because everything you produce is primed for conversion
[div]Strategic copywriters take home fatter paychecks. They’re proud to take ownership of their copy. And they don’t lose sleep over whether they’ll survive the next ChatGPT update.
[p]In a world with 123 million people calling themselves copywriters, buckling down on strategy is non-negotiable.
[p]But if you’re anything like me, you’re in the copy game to do more than simply “survive.”
[div]You’re here for the spoils of the strategic conversion copywriter life. Including:
[span]Sending a $10K proposal without breaking a sweat because you know what that copy can do for the client
[span]Checking the results for that project and realizing you could have charged way more (the client thinks so too – and they’ve started referring to you as “superstar” on team calls)
[span]Feeling low-key guilty when you have to tell leads you’re fully booked because they view you as the only option
[span]Realizing that you’re the one driving the unprecedented profits in your client’s business and if you don’t start getting better at setting boundaries, they’ll get you writing everything
[span]Fighting off feeling smug because while everyone else is frantically searching for gigs, you’re booked out solid from referrals
[p]And to top it all off, you’re the one getting those justified pay raises that go along with being a true expert:
[p]“I immediately 10X’d my rates”
[div]Abi Prendergast
[p]Copy School student
[p]“I booked my first $35k month.”
[div]Jesse Gernigin
[p]Copy School student

[div]Aja Stuart
[p]Copy School student
[p]“On my way to a $200K year.”
[div]Jacob Suckow
[p]Copy School student
[div]It’s simple, really:
[strong]To become the strategic copywriter every brand wants and no GPT can replace…
[div]It’s got to be Copy School.
[p]“I thought being a good writer was enough. WRONG.”
[p]“I credit Joanna with my entire career. Seriously. Before her trainings, I thought being a good writer was enough. WRONG. Thankfully, I found Joanna. Through her brilliant and super-easy-to-follow trainings, I fully booked out my business in under a year. Then I got my dream job writing copy for my idol full-time. Joanna’s techniques are groundbreaking.”
[div]Marian Schembari
[p]Copy Chief
[p]Being in Copy School means gaining complete mastery over what separates the
[span]copywriting elite
[p]from expensive mediocrity:
[strong]The stages of awareness →
[p]so you don’t lose prospects because you’ve delivered the right message at the wrong time
[strong]Tone and voice →
[p]so you can avoid hearing “yeah, this doesn’t sound like us” after you’ve spent hours crafting a high-converting email sequence
[strong]Customer research →
[p]so you never have to start from a blank page again
[em](because conversion copywriters understand that stellar copy is pulled from the mouths of your customers, not thin air)
[strong]Systems and SOPs →
[p]so you can replace “blank page anxiety” with complete confidence that you’re in control at every step of the project
[strong]Expectation matching →
[p]so your enthusiastic click doesn’t turn into an expensive bounce
[strong]Messaging hierarchies →
[p]so you’re confidently and strategically moving readers to the “heck YES” and not the “maybe later”
[strong]Cognitive biases →
[p]so you can frame your messaging in a way that aligns with the way customers make decisions
[strong]AI copy →
[p]so you can speed up execution while you stay firmly in your irreplaceable role of strategist
[p]☝️ This ☝️ is the high-level strategy mastery that immediately puts you eons above the rest. The stuff that right now intimidates the pants off you, so you employ the easier (and FAR riskier) strategy of winging it and hoping for the best.
[p]But if you never want to deal with the nail-biting anxiety of guessing again…
[p]If the idea of being at the top of your game lights a fire in you…
[p]And you have a burning desire to be the strategic mind behind the best copy money can buy…
[div]Then it’s time to BE
[span]the real deal.
[strong]And get sickeningly good at researching, strategizing and writing copy for
[p]SaaS, e-commerce, course creators, coaches, non-profits, service providers… basically
[strong]every niche that has good money to spend on high-converting copy.
[p]HERE’S WHAT BONA FIDE COPY LEGENDS ALREADY KNOW:
[p]To be the best,
[p]you’ve got to learn from the best.
[p]And that’s what Copy School is, hands down → The unrivaled training academy where the world’s top copywriters and business owners go to become
[span]certified copywriting gold.
[p]“These programs are making money for me over and over again.”

[p]“Get confidence your copy is damn good.”
[p]“Joanna’s trainings are incredible. Her techniques are genius in their simplicity. Her over-the-shoulder tutorials make absorbing the material both easy and fun. Even if you’re not a copywriter, you’ll be able to write with confidence and know it’s damn good.”
[div]Marie Forleo
[p]Entrepreneur
[p]“Know
[span]WHY
[p]your copy converts”
[p]“Copy School has been THE best investment I’ve made in my business, both as an online marketer and a copywriter. I know exactly why I put a word on a page and can explain that to my clients, so not only do they love the copy – they know why it’s converting too.”
[div]Prerna Malik

[p]Be
[span]the real deal.
[p]With
[p]Copy School is the only copywriting training hailed as the gold standard for beginners, intermediate
[span]AND
[p]advanced copywriters. It contains every framework, SOP, technique, and skill you need to crush ANY type of copy. So you can
[strong]walk into any room knowing you’re the most profitable person in it.
[p]“VALUE: Impossible to quantify”
[p]“I know I’m supposed to give a neat little “Copy School gave me a X% ROI” but it’s impossible for me to quantify the value that Copy School has given me and my clients. There isn’t a piece of copy that I’ve written that wasn’t influenced by something (usually somethings, plural) that I learned from Copy School. Doesn’t matter if it was a simple 43-word sale expiration email – and definitely if it was a 1,246-word monster FAQ email. Everything is influenced,
[strong]everything is more strategic, and everything is more conversion-focused.”

[p]WHAT’S INSIDE:
[p]Gain total mastery over the most lucrative assets in the game with any course from our 10X collection:
[p]Taking any one of these courses will give you the power to create a $10K deliverable for clients who understand the value of real copywriting.
[strong]That’s why we previously sold each course individually for $997.
[p]But today, you can own the entire collection when you say yes to Copy School.
[p]Prepare to have every part of the copywriting process demystified. Because each course will give you a
[span]step-by-step roadmap
[p]for doing what real copywriters do: research, strategy, message planning, testing, optimization… and occasionally, writing.
[p]WARNING
[p]The 10X way isn’t for everyone. It takes longer. It’s harder. That’s why so many copywriters settle for “good enough”.
[p]But you’re here because “good enough” isn’t your thing.
[p]You don’t want more hacks or “simple copywriting tricks” that marketing bros insist will get you to $1M overnight
[em]if you just fork out $10K.
[p]You want the real skill. The kind that pays off again and again, because once you know it, no one can take it from you.
[p]You see, 10X isn’t about being one in a million. It’s about rolling up your sleeves and doing the work everyone else skips over because they’re too busy chasing quick wins.
[p]But if you actively want to do that work. To let real, in-the-trenches copywriters forge you into the expert your dream clients need you to be…
[p]…then you go

[p]I come to client projects as an expert and get treated as such. It feels good.
[p]Copy School gave me the knowledge to shift from a ‘creative’ copywriter to one who really knew wtf she was doing and can charge accordingly. I can explain my reasoning. I can stick up for my copy. I can let go of my copy if tests show it needs optimising. I’m brutal with my darlings. And I can say yes to jobs I’m not fully comfortable with because I can just dip back into Copy School and get the intel.

[p]…And do it all without having to purchase any additional courses.
[p]“An entire career in a dashboard”
[p]For the copywriter gunning for the top, we’ve got even more to sink your teeth into…
[span]I want them all. I’m in
[p]“The sheer value inside Copy School is BREATHTAKING.”
[p]Copy School transformed my life. I wish that didn’t sound so cliched, because it’s 100% true. I’d been languishing as a writer and editor for years, eddying around in vague and largely unprofitable circles … I knew there had to be some way to scoop up my skills and start making them truly work for my business.
[p]Copy School showed me how to do that – big time! Like anyone, I battled with myself over the cost – it’s way more than pin money after all…! But believe me, it was the BEST investment I could ever have made.
[p]The sheer value inside Copy School is BREATHTAKING – hours of super-personal tutorial videos, workshops and webinars, titan templates, interviews, insights, and hundreds (thousands?!) of killer tips, cheatsheets and checklists
[p]It’s like Joanna and Ry emptied their entire heads into your brain, and arranged all their years of solid gold expertise on tiny, easy-access Skillz Shelves just for you!
[p]Armed with Copy School confidence, I’m now revolutionizing my business in ways I could never have imagined. I have a brand new website, I’m already helping clients convert more prospects through deeply researched, targeted web and email copy – and I’m bloody loving it!!
[p]Seriously, if you’re even slightly on the fence about Copy School – just jump in. You will land in a World of Joy 🙂 .”

[p]FAQs
[p]“Can I really charge $1000 for an email?”
[p]… AND ANSWERS TO OTHER SMART QUESTIONS:
[a]How long will it take to start seeing the results of my efforts pay off?
[span]The easy answer is:
[span]Much faster than with everyone’s not-so-favorite trial and error approach.
[span]Our students have seen huge lifts in conversion rates, signups, sales, and more after only watching a handful of videos.
[span]Of course, you have to show up and put in the work. But it’s totally worth it.
[span]Because when you build on proven processes and strategies…
[span]When you see the wins yourself…
[span]When you know you’re the most profitable person in the room…
[span]It gets much, much easier to charge higher rates. Take calls with dream clients. And delight existing clients so much that they’ll ask you to write all the things.
[span]That said, how quickly you see results will depend on certain factors – things like: how much time you devote to your training, whether you’re working full-time or part-time and whether you’re freelance or in-house.
[span]For example, a freelance copywriter without any prior copywriting experience might take a little longer to see the results in their paycheck than an experienced freelance copywriter (because the new freelancer will also need to devote time to finding clients).
[span]On the other hand, an in-house copywriter working for a company with an engaged list could take a handful of lessons on sales emails, apply their learnings, fire off a few strategic emails to their list and bring in near-instant wins for their team.
[span]Regardless of where you are now, Copy School shows you exactly what steps to take with your copy to establish yourself as the most profitable person in the room, so you can skyrocket your earning potential – in a surprisingly short timeframe.
[a]I’m new to copywriting. Will this work for me?
[span]In Copy School, you get clear bite-sized instructions – never too short, never too long. With formulas and frameworks to make everything you learn as execution-friendly as possible.
[span]We’ve trained copywriters at every level – like:
[span]Beginner Bayardo Barrios who used Copy School to land $3,000 projects from the get-go. And…
[span]Seasoned copywriter Marian Schembari who used Copy School’s email training to help her client Teachable make $500K – easily justifying her new $500 per email rate.
[span]As a new copywriter, you should start with the quick and foundational
[span]10x Landing Pages.
[span]With just this course under your belt, you can write copy that converts. And you have a strong foundation to start building your portfolio and taking on copy projects.
[span]From there, you can dive into training programs that interest you. Or you can dive into programs that align with the projects you’re working on.
[span]No matter your starting point…
[span]Copy School is set up to help you execute advanced copywriting and marketing strategies with the confidence of a seasoned pro. Even if you’ve never written copy before.
[a]I’m an experienced copywriter. Do I actually need Copy School?
[span]You’ll find countless invaluable frameworks, templates and processes that were created by us while working with a huge range of clients like Wistia, Canva, Neil Patel, Amy Porterfield, Todd Herman – and so many others.
[span]We didn’t try X once, see it perform decently and turn it into training. We tried X multiple times, for multiple audiences, and multiple products, and multiple offers.
[span]Unlike other courses that share the expertise of one person, Copy School pulls together the expertise of 14+ top copywriters and marketers.
[span]Our team is made up of real practitioners with bookoodles of experience working with big name clients on the daily.
[span]When it comes to mastering modern day marketing assets with unique processes, insights and templates, Copy School is the only program we know of that will get you there.
[a]I work in a niche industry… will Copy School work for me?
[span]Many (if not all) of the copy techniques you learn inside Copy School are transferable to any industry, because:
[b]Persuasion is about people – not about business type.
[span]We know because we’ve tested them while working with a huge range of clients like Wistia, Canva, Neil Patel, Amy Porterfield, Todd Herman – field-testing everything we teach multiple times, for multiple audiences, multiple products and multiple offers in multiple industries.
[span]Just the funnel copy system taught in
[span]10x Funnels
[span]alone has generated $24+ million in revenue across 37 industries.
[span]With Copy School, you can easily work with companies in different industries without spending months learning the subtle differences.
[a]I’m busy. And this course seems ginormous. How will I actually finish Copy School?
[span]You’re right. Copy School is ridiculously comprehensive. (Almost “too” comprehensive – if there’s such a thing.)
[span]Copy School is essentially an entire masters-level program behind a single login.
[p]And because you’re getting Copy School “outright” (i.e., with no recurring subscriptions), you can take as long as you’d like to actually USE the training.
[span]And here’s what you’ll love:
[span]You don’t need to finish Copy School to profit from it. Not even close.
[span]It’s not a cumulative program that demands an unreasonable amount of time and consistency to get results.
[span]You can watch a single lesson in 10x Emails, for example, then go write an email with it.
[span]In fact, some of our biggest success stories generated their 5x, 10x, 20x wins with just a single module of one course – that is, with just a small fraction of what will be at your disposal on the other side of this page.
[span]That said, we DO encourage our students to go through the entire program (at your own pace). Whether you’re an experienced copywriter or you’re making a shift into a copywriting career, the monetary rewards of having results-based mastery over your ads, landing pages, web pages, emails, sales pages, funnels and launches are just too high to pass up.
[a]Are these instructors the real deal?
[span]Yes. Inside Copy School you AREN’T learning from well-meaning amateurs who wrote something once (maybe twice) and then decided to teach it.
[span]This major league training team comes with decades of professional copywriting and marketing experience.
[span]We’ve created, tested and honed the frameworks, templates and processes we teach inside Copy School with companies like Wistia, Canva, Hubspot, WP Engine, and other Fortune 50 companies who cannot be named.
[span]Our work has driven millions and millions and millions of dollars in revenue for the clients we partner with.
[span]In other words, we’re professionals who are on the ground, doing the work and seeing the results every single day.
[span]It begs the question:
[span]Why learn from anyone else when you can train with the team that knows without a doubt how to write and drive sales?
[a]Will I have to wait before accessing any of the material?
[span]Not here. Our goal is to give you the highest possible ROI right out of the gate – ideally within hours or days.
[span]That means, we don’t hold your lessons hostage, dripping new modules out over weeks or months.
[span]You get FULL access to everything in Copy School the second you wrap up your enrollment on the next page.
[span]No waiting. No slow-drip BS.
[span]Right now you can load up lessons for writing:
[span]Sales emails
[span]Sales pages
[span]Web pages
[span]About pages
[span]Pricing pages
[span]4 complete funnels
[span]Welcome / Nurturing emails
[span]Seasonal sales promos with emails, ads and SMS
[span]Homepages
[span]Not to mention training including:

[span]Brand voice
[span]Headline mastery
[li]Thank you pages
[li]SMS
[span]As long as you’re committed to turning your words into revenue, we’re committed to pulling out all the stops to get you there.
[a]How does the no-questions-asked money-back guarantee work?
[span]With over 5,000 happy students, we know you’re going to love Copy School. But, for whatever reason, if you don’t feel like you’re any closer to skyrocketing your earning potential with winning copy, simply send an email to
[a]support@copyhackers.com
[span]within 7 days of joining and we’ll refund every dollar of your initial payment.
[a]If I own it, can I sell it?
[p]No.
[p]It’s still our intellectual property, and we retain full copyright over every part of it.
[p]Also, if you’ve heard of people buying Copy School or any program for $39 or whatever on some random download site, know that they stole it from us. They are
[em]charging you
[p]for a product they
[em]stole from us
[p]while actually victimizing others, too.
[p]They steal a credit card. Use it to join. Download everything. Then the either ask for a refund (so they can keep using the stolen CC without the actual owner knowing). Or they just wait for the owner of the CC to find out and process a fraud charge.
[p]We don’t believe in behavior like this. We don’t believe it’s “every man for himself.”
[p]That’s why we keep our prices reasonable and trust you with instant access and the ability to download the training. Because a few bad apples don’t get to ruin it for everyone.
[a]What payment methods do you accept?
[span]You can check out securely online using your favorite credit card, Apple Pay, Google Pay or Paypal.
[a]Can you quickly remind me of everything I’m getting in Copy School?
[span]Sure! The most insanely comprehensive, ROI-focused copywriting training on the planet comes with instant access to:
[span]Actionable copywriting training, including all our 10x programs:
[span]10x Web Copy ($1997)
[span]10x Sales Pages ( $1997)

[span]Dozens of proven templates, worksheets & checklists
[span]7+ top copywriting & marketing instructors in your back pocket
[span]… and a full 7 days to test drive it all risk-free.
[span]How much is Copy School worth?
[span]A LOT.
[span]$12,000+ to be exact.
[span]But the more important question is:
[b]“How much can Copy School make me?”
[span]You decide.
[span]Because when you can write copy that converts, my friend, your profit potential is limitless.
[p]Can I get real with you for a sec?
[p]This is a pretty frightening time to be a “good enough” copywriter. Because although ChatGPT still has a long way to go before it can write great copy without someone who understands great copy prompting then editing it…
[p]More and more clients are settling for “good enough” AI-written content as a way to cut down on costs.
[p]This puts you in an exciting position. Exciting, because it forces you to make a choice.
[p]Will you…
[p]1. Get comfortable competing with ChatGPT and 123 million other people calling themselves copywriters (which sadly, tends to mean dropping your prices)
[p]Or…
[p]2.
[strong]Get so unbelievably, sickeningly good
[p]at writing and strategizing conversion copy that you’re in a league of your own (which means being in full control of your rates because clients need your expertise)
[p]Copy School students are choosing the second option. And because Copy School has comprehensive roadmaps for just about every copy skill you’ll ever need…
[p]Rising to the top of your game no longer needs to feel like skating uphill.
[p]So if you’re here to close projects that demand celebration. To max out your 401(k) year after year. For Mediterranean cruises. Flying first class. For Prada.
[p]…and all the other perks that come with being *SO* much more than “good enough”…

We’ve made every effort to represent accurately the products we offer and their potential. However, we and our materials make no guarantee of results, nor should you misinterpret the “10x” part of our products’ names to suggest you will grow your business by an amount such as ten times; in reality, “10x” represents the quantity of ads, emails and landing pages you will be educated to complete with success after taking our training, and the additional quantity may help you achieve strong results similar to those we’ve achieved using the same techniques.
