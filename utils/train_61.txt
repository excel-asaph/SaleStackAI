[i]It’s Worth It?
[b]From: Peng Joon
[b]Entrepreneurs (Both With & Without Event Experience) Are Reporting Making More Money In A Single Weekend Following the Virtual Event Codex Than They Did The Entire Previous Year!
[b]It’s TRUE.
[div]Events have been making a few folks very, very wealthy for a long time.
[b]Real estate investing seminars › Estate planning conferences › Book writing workshops.
[div]All are common examples of live events that have been happening for decades… giving the event hosts massive opportunities to cash in on the crowds that came flocking…
[div]Before, you’d need to have a
[b]broad offer to a large audience
[div]to make the expenses of hosting live events worthwhile, and most importantly, profitable.
[div]But, recently
[b]we’ve seen a shift
[div].
[div]Something happened that has pretty much killed off live events.
[div]I don’t need to say it but you and I know that live events will never be the same again…

[b]How do I know this?
[b]I used to speak in live events like crazy…
[b]How do I know this?
[b]I used to speak in live events like
[b]crazy…
[b]When the lockdown happened, I was in Poland doing my event and was told that I had 24 hours to leave the country or else I would be stuck in that country for at least another 30 days as borders would be closed.
[b]When the lockdown happened, I was in Poland doing my event and was told that I had 24 hours to leave the country or else I would be stuck in that country for at least another 30 days as borders would be closed.
[span]I decided to cancel the event and refund the participants…
[span]Understanding that LIVE Events would be dead…
[b]I decided to pivot…
[span]In the month of May 2020, when pretty much the rest of the world was on lockdown, we still
[b]maintained sales of over $1MM that month...
[div]It can truly be the best of times or the worst of times.
[h2]Would you like to guess where those spikes in sales came from?
[b]That’s right…
[b]Virtual Events.
[b]I’ve come away with a few lessons from:
[b]Spending literally millions of dollars
[li]of my own money to host these events
[li]Learning
[b]MANY hard lessons
[li]along the way
[li]Rightfully
[b]charging $50,000+ to show others
[li]how to do events like this, which is actually worth much more
[li]​Literally cracking the code on
[b]running a profitable live event
[li]… which can be replicated in ANY niche and location
[b]… plus, it’s NOT hard.

[div]"After training with Peng Joon, I have learned how to monetise my brand, I have greater clarity on what direction I'm heading, and my business has been transformed and multiplied because of Peng Joon."
[b]– Julius Dein
[div]“If you’re looking to do events, drive traffic, sell products, I highly recommend working with Peng Joon”
[b]– Russell Brunson
[div]“Peng Joon just changed my life. I didn’t know how to and where to start and I’m walking away with more confidence than ever before.”
[b]– Alison Prince
[b](which I’m going to show you, in detail):
[b]Yep, it’s that simple.
[b]Keep reading
[div]because before the end of this page I’m going to
[b]walk you through all 5 steps
[div]so you can see
[b]EVERYTHING you need to launch
[div]and deploy wildly successful
[b], predictably profitable, and extremely FUN virtual events
[div]… all from the comfort of your own home, with no fancy tech.
[b]… even if you’ve never thrown one before
[div], are in a tiny niche, or don’t think you can pull this off.
[div]While I know running events of 100 to over 1,000 people can seem intimidating, especially if you’ve never done them before, but what if you did your first event that had only 10 people?
[div]Do you think you could get 10 people in a Zoom room together, as a start? (I’ll even show you how).
[div]Can you reveal the
[b]best things you know in your area of expertise to a group of 10 people
[div], and charge them just $500 for a seat to attend? (Yep, you can and I’ll make sure of it)
[b]It’s seriously that easy.
[div]After you did that, do you think you’ll eventually have the confidence to maybe do an event of 20 people? (Yep you will)
[div]I don’t know about you, but
[b]those who follow my lead make more money off of their weekends and events
[div]than most make their entire YEAR slaving away all 5 days of the week.
[div](And virtual events are a whole heck of a lot more fun and fulfilling, trust me!)
[div]Let’s face it.
[div]You already know
[b]the value of virtual events
[div], I don’t need to sit here and try to persuade you on that.
[div]You also know there’s nothing else like it.
[b]You get the best of both worlds.
[b]How Would You Like to Take My Last Decade of Experience of Doing THIS:
[b]… And Turning It Into THIS:
[b]Imagine doing this from home…
[div]no fancy tech, laptop stacked on top of a bunch of books with a decent mic… while doing it in your underwear! (if that’s your thing)
[div]You don’t HAVE to go with a low-tech setup… high end works too… I eventually built up a full-fledged studio, either way,
[b]don’t allow the tech to be the thing that’s keeping you stuck…
[b]How would you like me to show you EVERYTHING you need to do to launch virtual events in YOUR business, plus give you ALL the tools you need (already done)… withOUT paying me $50,000 to walk you through everything?
[b]Think of it as the virtual events of virtual events…

[div]“I thought I knew about how to throw and monetise live events, but apparently not! I know that I will be able to double our conversions just from what I discovered from Peng Joon.”
[b]- Alex Dee

[div]Normally if you were to
[b]attend any of our LIVE events, it is $3,997 per person.
[div](That means, to bring a family of 4 - like mine - it would cost $16,000!)
[div]Oh, and you have flights… hotels… and food costs.
[div]But, since we’re going to be
[b]streaming it LIVE into your home
[div], or to your phone…
[div]And because
[b]I want your business to THRIVE
[div]during these crazy times…
[div]Well, it’s kinda for free…
[b]Let me explain:
[div]The
[b]conference costs $197
[div]to attend…
[div]BUT… I want to
[b]make sure that you LOVE IT BEFORE you pay…
[div]So, this is how it works.
[div]You just put in your credit card numbers to reserve your seat, but
[b]you won't be billed ANYTHING YET…
[div]And then AFTER the conference,
[b]IF you LOVE IT, and IF it changes your life…
[div]Then do NOTHING, and
[b]we’ll bill you the $197 AFTER
[div]it’s over.
[span]YES! I Want To Join The FREE 3-Day Intensive And Get $3,997 Worth Of Training For FREE!
[h2]If so, then we’ll cancel your order, and
[b]you will never pay anything.
[b]Cool…!
[h2](That way, you only pay if you feel it was worth every penny!)
[div]This is not something that you buy... And then “hopefully you’ll get around to watching it later”.
[b]This is a LIVE event...
