[title]Copywriting Mastery
[b]At Last, I’ve Revealed The Easiest Way To…
[b]Sell A Shit Load Of Stuff
[b]…Without Wasting Money On Ads
[span]From Godson Okorodudu
[p]Best Selling Product Creator
[span]Dear entrepreneur,
[span]In just a moment, I would reveal what you need to rapidly increase your profits irrespective of what you sell.
[span]But first,
[em]let me ask you a question…
[strong]What do you think is the main difference between businesses that generate 6 or 7 figures monthly and others struggling to get by?
[span]You might have answered by saying sales volume
[span]And you are correct.
[span]The problem is that most people don’t know the one thing that is responsible for increasing sales volumes…
[span]That is what I’m going to expose to you in this letter.
[span]You see, for most businesses (whether online or offline), there seems to be a glass ceiling on growth…
[span]After a certain level they simply max out.
[span]Similar businesses may be making 3x, 5x or even 10x more sales and profits but you are inevitably stuck with a low level of income
[span]You might have tried many different things to increase your outcomes without any luck
[span]But lucky for you, you are right here learning about the solution.
[p]Come with me…
[span]I had my foray into the world of business and marketing in the
[em]early 2000s
[span]and I have been selling
[strong]stuff online since 2009 (over 12 years now)
[span]During this time I was exposed to different products, niches, and markets … but when it came to driving sales they all had ONE THING in common, and that was…
[strong]MESSAGING
[p]or what we call
[em]Copywriting
[span]Of course, you already knew that;
[b]The Ability To Craft Sales Messages That Grab Total Strangers By The Horn And Force Them To Take Out Their Wallets And Buy Must Be That ONE thing
[span]Whether the message is delivered in a video, audio, or the good ol’ written sales letter…
[span]It needs to be compelling enough to convert strangers into customers.
[span]And you should also know that…
[b]It’s Always Better When You Write Your Own Copy
[span]Some people think that hiring a copywriter is a valid alternative.
[span]Well, the truth is that nobody can craft your sales messages like you, because…
[strong]You understand your products, services, and customers
[em]better than any copywriter ever will
[span]And this insight is the baseline requirement for crafting exceptional sales copy
[span]Now I am not saying an expert copywriter wouldn’t write good copy for you,
[span]What I mean is that your insight into your business
[strong]puts you in a firm position to craft superior sales messages
[em](…once you can figure out how this copywriting thingy works)
[strong]You should also know that most of the very best copywriters, write copy for themselves (ONLY!)
[span]For example…
[span]My courses have been watched in more than
[strong]80 different countries,
[span]and by several thousands of students… thanks to my
[em]uncanny ability to craft super persuasive sales messages.
[span]Some of these courses
[strong]pull in over $120,000 recurring income
[span](…and that’s being conservative)
[span]Others bring-in ‘Crazy’ figures I don’t like to mention in public
[span]Yes, it’s also true that…
[strong]Non-English speakers do translate my sales messages
[span], read them, and pay for my training (after which they ask for PDF’s so they can translate and read in their language)
[span]That was baaad… but it wasn’t even a
[em]surprise
[span]to me…
[strong]What baffled me the most was that…
[span]DEAF persons
[em](no offense to them)
[span]sent requests for closed-caption on the videos (what we also call sub-titles)…
[span]And several of them purchased even though we could only offer PDF’s to read
[span]As crazy as that sounds… that’s not all…
[span]I’ve even had to reject
[strong]mouth-watering copywriting offers
[span]from several top companies and 7 figure ecom. entrepreneurs.
[span]That’s just to demonstrate how powerful you are about to become.
[span]But I have to admit that…
[b]Writing “Good” Copy Isn’t The Easiest Thing In The World
[span]It requires a deeper understanding of human psychology and behavior
[span]It demands a certain level of awareness that is scarcely found or even taught
[strong]And many who attempt it, never fully attain the mark
[span]But the
[em]good news is…
[span]From my experience teaching people to write copy,
[span]I’ve discovered that
[strong]just about anyone can become an excellent copywriter
[span]with the right training.
[span]And very recently,
[span]I decided to
[strong]combine all my knowledge
[span]blended with my experience
[strong]writing and training copywriters and…
[span]Distilled them into what could easily be one of the
[strong]best copywriting training courses
[span]in the world –
[b]COPYWRITING MASTERY
[span]It’s a complete guide for entrepreneurs and marketers who want to wield
[strong]the power to craft persuasive sales messages
[span]Whether in the form of ads, sales pages, or video sales letters…
[span]this 6 hrs+ training program would take you from
[strong]novice to pro
[span]…even if you’ve
[strong]never written a single line of copy
[span]in your life.
[span]Not that you’d start writing badass copy overnight or anything like that…
[span]But you’d have discovered the core principles and insights to…
[strong]Writing compelling messages that get people to take out their wallets and buy.

[b]How Much Does It Cost?
[span]Firstly, you should know that this newly released course is
[strong]not priced at $2,995,
[span]which is what other people are charging for this kind of program.
[em]Are they overpriced?
[span]As a matter of fact – I believe the firm answer is NO,  because…
[span]Average copywriters demand similar amounts for just ONE sales letter
[span]But that fee would put it out of the reach of many persons…
[span]So I have decided to crash the price by dividing it by 3
[span]Pay
[strong]just $997 today
[span]and you can keep all my copywriting secrets for a lifetime.

[b]Is This For You?
[span]Now listen, if you haven’t enrolled yet, I really want to talk to you because, as great as this course is, I understand it’s absolutely not for everybody.
[span]I want you to be sure this is right for you when you enroll today
[span]That’s why we should take a minute and just
[strong]go through the pros and cons of what we’re about to do together.
[span]The pros are…
[span]I have a
[strong]great deal of experience
[span]writing, and training copywriters, I have broken down the ideas and core principles into
[strong]tiny digestible bits for anyone to understand
[span]Another pro is that
[strong]you don’t need to have any previous experience
[span]writing sales messages
[span]This is a
[strong]complete course
[span]. Many courses don’t show you in practical terms how to combine all the principles you’d learn into a single persuasive sales letter.
[span]I suffered this when I was learning the ropes, and I’ve
[strong]included a step-by-step guide for putting pen on “marketing paper” powerfully!
[span]My methods of teaching are simple, but don’t let that fool you,
[span]What you’d discover is deep enough to help you
[strong]create compelling messages for any type of product/service
[span]and in any format (Video, Text, Audio)…
[span]…on a timeline
[span]Once you’ve gotten a hang of it,
[strong]you are immediately
[em]guaranteed
[strong]more sales, revenue, and insane profits!
[span]But it’s not all roses, not everything is perfect in this…
[span]For example,
[strong]I admit this isn’t the cheapest thing
[span]in the world. “This is an expensive training (for some).”
[span]Also, this is going to take a pretty significant investment of time for you.
[span]We have an investment of money & time and it’s not overnight. You have to work pretty hard to do this.
[span]If you don’t have the time to do it, it’s not going to be of any benefit to you.”
[span]Of course, there’s also always the question of,
[strong]“What if it doesn’t work for me?”
[span]Well, fact of the matter is it might not.
[span]If you’re not willing to work hard, if you’re not willing to follow directions, if you’re not willing to stick through the inevitable challenges, it definitely won’t work for you and you shouldn’t enroll.
[span]Well, you know, if after looking at all of this and if
[strong]it looks like this makes sense to you.
[span]Then you really need to go ahead and
[strong]enroll in the training today
[span]and don’t forget
[strong]we’ve got bonuses and the offer is going to expire.

[b]Is It Worth the price?
[span]A lot of people tell me it is expensive.
[span]Yeah, I get it. It is.
[span]Let’s fast forward a year from now and assume you’ve been following along and now use the training to crank out great copies…
[span]Your
[strong]sales numbers have been spiking all year round
[span], and you now make more money than you know what to do with…
[strong]How would that feel?
[span]Well if you divide $997 by a year. It’s just $2.73 a day
[span]Now tell me, What’s more important?
[span]– $2.73 or your ability to craft high converting sales messages for your products and services?
[span]– $2.73 or the savings you make each time you write your own copy (instead of hiring a copywriter for $1k, 2k, $3,000 per copy)?
[span]– $2.73 or making so much more sales that you never have to worry about money again?
[span]– $2.73 or becoming the top, well-respected name in your industry?
[span]Hey, if I need to, I’ll even send you a check for $2.73 to cover your first day if it’s that big of a deal to you.
[span]Why? Because $2.73 is nothing. I’m not going to miss it and neither would you;
[span]But, if that’s what it takes to help you get the results you deserve, I’ll have it on your doorstep tomorrow. Just call or email after you’ve enrolled and I’ll send it FedEx.
