[p]People often ask Dan,
[em]"What’s the fastest and easiest way to have a 5, 6 or even 7 figure payday?"
[p]. Platform Closing Secrets is his answer.
[p]If you already use speaking in your business as an “amature” doing an okay job selling from the platform for your own business, this is a quantum leap to a much higher level of effectiveness, ease, and influence.
[p]Dan has worked with MANY business owners in diverse industries who, in just a few months, have gone from “competent” to “extraordinary” in speaking and closing from the stage or virtual events. If you’re new around here you may not know their names. But if you’ve been watching Dan’s career for any length of time you will have seen many of these rising stars at live events held by Dan or on recorded material available in the Dan Lok Shop.
[p]Of course, there are different levels of skill. And Dan’s not suggesting he can turn you into him. He’s been doing this for over 20 years and has a highly-trained subconscious mind that allows him to step into any communication situation and become instantly persuasive.
[p]But he can certainly equip anybody who's good with a bigger, better bag of tricks... and he can certainly take a relative newbie and bring them up to competence almost instantly.
[strong]Here’s the bottom line:
[p]once you finish watching
[em]Platform Closing Secrets™
[p], you will be one of the very few people with the highly profitable skill of selling one-to-many!
[p]You’ll automatically become a better, more confident, and instantly more persuasive speaker, whether on stage, over the phone, in groups small or large.
