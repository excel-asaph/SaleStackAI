[h1]WHAT IS IT?
[p]Let me be direct…
[p]I know you’ve probably seen the $10,000.00 investment for this training, which already makes it "
[strong]out of reach
[p]" for many who’ll read this page.
[p]I don’t know if this offer is for you or not, but what I do know is that I only want to attract serious people who recognize true value when they see it.
[p]If I asked you to pay me $10,000.00 and I could practically promise I would pay you back $100,000.00 every year for the rest of your life…
[p]Would that be enough value for you to keep on reading?
[p]As the world's most successful investor Warren Buffett often says: "
[em]Price is what you pay. Value is what you get.
[p]"
[p]And because you’re still reading, I’ll assume you’re someone who appreciates value more than most.
[p]So, before we continue, I think it’s safe to say, this training isn't for everyone. The investment alone makes that obvious…
[p]But it’s also true because we’re only looking for people who want to create
[strong]BIG
[p]movements in their industries and niches.
[p]So, let’s see if you fit into one of these 3 categories.
[li]You consider yourself an "
[em]Advanced Expert
[li]" in your field.
[li]This means, you're a knowledge expert and phenomenal at what you do,
[strong]BUT
[li], you haven't figured out how to charge premium fees, enroll high ticket clients, and hone your coaching skills to deliver outstanding client results, yet.
[li]You know without a shadow of a doubt that figuring this out could immediately add $100,000, $200,000, $500,000, or more to your revenue
[strong]THIS YEAR
[li].
[li]And all you need is the right knowledge and guidance to make it happen.
[strong]OR
[li], perhaps you’re new to the coaching space…
[li]You dream of becoming a highly paid coach because you know the industry is
[em]booming
[li]right now…
[li]And you feel this could be your "
[em]golden opportunity
[li]" to "
[strong]scale up
[li]" your income and create a better life for you and your family.
[li]But you feel you can't do it without the "
[strong]right
[li]" skills -- and a world-recognized certification -- available
[strong]ONLY
[li]from Dan Lok.
[strong]OR
[li], you’re a business owner looking to "
[em]clone
[li]" yourself and scale your team, so you can get more done.
[li]This will help you multiply the number of clients your business serves by 10X or more, and in doing so, even add an
[strong]extra ZERO
[li]to your revenue in the next 12 months.
[li]You know "
[em]cloning
[li]" yourself means your team handles the bulk of the work, but you
[strong]lack
[li]the specific skillset to make that happen
[strong]RIGHT NOW
[li]…
[li]And you realize this
[strong]MISSING
[li]skillset is stifling your business growth and costing you thousands of dollars each day and week, and you
[strong]shudder
[li]to think what it’s costing you every year that goes by.
[p]If you fit
[strong]ANY
[p]of these 3 categories, then getting accredited as a
[em]High Ticket Coach™
[p]could be
[strong]the most important thing
[p]you do for your life, career, and business this year.
[p]Why?
[p]Because all those benefits, and many more, are readily available
[strong]ONLY
[p]inside Dan’s
[em]"HIGH-TICKET COACH™ Certification Program"
[p].
[p]And if what you’ve read so far has piqued your interest, then you could potentially receive training from someone who is arguably one of the best coaches and trainers on the planet.
[p]So, here’s a little information about the
[em]High Ticket Coach™ Certification
[p], before we get into
[strong]WHY
[em]High Ticket Coach™
[p]is so relevant, important, and much needed.
[em]High Ticket Coach™
[p]is our premier and elite coaching program.
[p]Over 90 days, Master Trainer and Coach Alex Mandossian will coach you through the
[em]High Ticket Coach™ Certification Program
[p].
[p]Alex is a man whose knowledge and expertise have generated nearly $417 million in sales for himself, his clients and students, and his joint venture partners.
[p]He lives and breathes
[em]High Ticket Coach™
[p], and I can think of no one better to take you from where you are now to where you want to be.
[p]So, no matter if you’re a complete beginner…
[p]Have an already established coaching or consulting business…
[p]Or you’re a business owner looking to gain high-level coaching skills so you can "
[strong]clone
[p]" yourself, and scale your business and team…
[p]It’s in your best interest to continue reading this short but potentially life-changing message.
[h1]WHY IS IT RELEVANT?
[p]Did you know that the coaching industry is the second-fastest-growing industry on the planet?
[p]It continues to grow year on year and is currently worth a staggering USD $2.4 billion.
[u]www.authentic.com.au
[p].
[p]Simply put, coaching works, but you must have the "
[em]right
[p]" coaching methods.
[p]So, it doesn’t matter which category above you identify with, coaching
[strong]WILL
[p]work for your situation.
[p]Because included in that
[strong]USD $2.4 billion
[p]are coaches hired by businesses to coach and train their employees.
[p]So, if you’re thinking "
[em]I don’t want to be a coach. I already have a successful business…
[p]", and you’re looking to scale your team…
[p]Then high-level coaching skills are the holy grail when it comes to team scaling and training.
[p]Why?
[p]Because "
[strong]little hinges swing big doors
[p]", and having coaching skills greatly improves your ability to transfer your knowledge to your team members in the most efficient way possible,
[strong]AND
[p]get the best out of them.
[p]As you can see, the coaching industry is a phenomenal industry to be in
[strong]IF
[p]you have the right skills
[strong]AND
[p]you’re attracting high-value prospects, willing to pay you high-ticket fees for your expertise.
[p]You’ll know this to be true, whether you’re brand new or you’ve been coaching or consulting for a while.
[p]The
[em]High Ticket Coach™
[p]90-day coaching certification is the brainchild of Dan Lok, and Alex Mandossian, and includes
[strong]state-of-the-art and cutting-edge coaching techniques and strategies
[p]that will really move the needle in your business and life.
[p]It has the power to fast-track your career and business success from:
[li]Being a relative newbie to a highly paid coach…
[li]Being an established coach or consultant to being a coach who attracts high-ticket clients and continues to hone their skills month on month…
[li]Being a business owner wanting to scale their team to a business owner who knows how to transfer their skills and scale their team into a highly-effective powerhouse of A-players.
[p]So, if you like what you’ve read so far, then I encourage you to continue to find out exactly how this groundbreaking training program can swing big doors for you in your career and business.
[h1]HOW WILL IT HELP?
[p]In the coaching and business world, you’ve got two choices.
[p]Either you set your value
[strong]OR
[p]your marketplace sets it for you.
[p]It just comes down to which “self” you listen to…
[p]Your “lower-self” (which is low self-esteem and self-worth), or your “higher-self”, (which is high self-esteem, and self-worth.)
[p]The choice is yours and you’re right either way.
[p]But, it’s for this reason that there are so many underpaid and unsuccessful coaches.
[p]This is why, as a coach, it pays you to know your worth and set your own value.
[p]That way, as your expertise grows, so do your fees and the success of your business.
[p]And the same applies if you’re a business owner.
[p]As a business owner, at every level of growth, the success of your business relies heavily on your ability to hire and train your team.
[p]It doesn’t matter whether you’re hiring your 1st or your 50th employee…
[p]It’s the skills you possess that you pass on to your team members, that they pass on to your future employees, with minimal supervision from you…
[p]That creates the biggest difference between running a well-oiled machine or a tractor in desperate need of new tires and an engine.
[p]Now, before you make your final decision by hitting the

[b]Hello HTC Community channel Razmig MalkhassianI just had my 7th call with my coach Razmig Malk...
[p]Our focus was on the distinctions of the FCC vs a closing call. The encoding of the HTC way is as different as night and day when it comes to effectivity at the highest level, it actually speeds the process up by slowing down, itÕs counterintuitive, yet it controls the higher outcome and the anticipation from the prospect to want to get started. It is the sampler that makes the craving even more of a desire to get the results with confirmation. Setting the expectations for the closing call after the FCC, (and keeping the interval short) ÒfeelsÓ like you have given the prospect the control, and this is why HTC is different than anything I have ever seen. It also gives the prospect a guide to establish feedback and preparing their clarifying thoughts for the closing call and what has been thought through in between these two calls. DONÕT solve their problem, instead, Create the space that defines their desire to have this solved and that difference separates you from 95% of the market Upward HTC community!
