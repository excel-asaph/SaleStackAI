[strong]right
[li]" training to help you sell your high ticket products and services with confidence.
[p]Have we guessed right so far? (If we have, then please keep reading).
[p]Because if you fit neither category above, then you’re welcome to close this page immediately unless you’ve got time to kill and feel like reading for the next few minutes.
[p]Either way, Dan and his team have compiled a collection of his favorite and most effective closing (sales) and business trainings.
[p]Trainings that aim to take you from where you are now, to the point where you’re closing high ticket deals like their going out of fashion…
[strong]AND

[li]again, plus so much more.
[p]So, if that sounds enticing to you, then continue reading to discover why this impactful collection is so relevant in today’s marketplace and economic climate.
[h1]WHY IS IT RELEVANT?
[p]The "middle-class" is being swiftly demolished...
[p]It’s now more important than ever you begin selling high ticket products and services and install high-profit margins into your business…
[p]Otherwise you’ll be stuck selling low to mid ticket offers and continue struggle, especially as times continue to get tighter and tougher.
[p]Now, imagine you could sell high ticket products, have high margins,
[strong]AND
[p]attract more high ticket clients
[strong]WITHOUT
[p]spending more money on rising marketing costs, because…
[p]As you may know, inflation is hitting all-time highs throughout the world.
[p]And at the rate it’s going, by the time you finish reading this, your gas (petrol) amongst other things could be more expensive.
[p]Now, if that’s not a reason to sell high ticket, then I don’t know what is.
[p]But, let’s get candid for a moment…
[strong]Here’s the cold harsh truth about selling high ticket.
[p]Almost everyone (including Dan) lacks the confidence to ask for big money when they first start out.
[p]They feel like an imposter…
[p]They ask themselves disempowering questions like “
[em]Why would anyone pay ME thousands of dollars for my services?
[p]"
[p]And they have limiting beliefs holding them back from greatness and the success they desire.
[p]If they don’t give up, and do finally build the confidence needed to sell high ticket and grow their business (usually through years of trial, error, pain, and frustration)…
[p]And they begin hiring closers to help them sell more, if they don’t ensure their profit margins stay high…
[p]They become less and less profitable, and it’s not uncommon for businesses to grow themselves out of business.
[p]I know it sounds unimaginable but it’s true, and it’s because as you grow your expenses grow with you.
[p]So, here’s how these 5 impactful trainings work together to give you the confidence to…
[strong]run a successful high ticket business with high profit margins while keeping your costs of acquiring customers as low as possible
[p].
[h1]HOW WILL IT HELP?

[li]Attract better (high value) clients, and maintain healthy profit margins even Bill Gates or Elon Musk would be jealous of…
