[p]PYTA is worth the money for anyone serious having any amount of success on YouTube. The greatest value is the amount of time saved by having all the information organized in a consise and actionable manner. It’s possible one can learn this on your own, but likely not without having had extensive prior experience or going through many ups and downs. The learnings from PYTA are not a magic, one-shot, guaranteed method to success. Rather this gives your the workflows and focus on what matters. Your responsibility is to stay consistent, learn and iteratively improve.

[p]I’ve gotten some big aha moments about titles, thumbnails, and other options for the flow of my YouTube videos. I’ve taught my GPT to better assist me by teaching what I’m learning from you along the way. I’m already seeing an increase in views on my channel. The most powerful part was level setting expectations of what I should post. I was telling myself to do more long form videos and all these things, but when he said 1 long form video and 2 reels per week that settled me and made things feel less overwhelming.

[p]Part-Time YouTuber Academy is by far one of the best investments I made during my own YouTube journey. I got started back in 2021 without a clear vision of the trajectory of my channel. I’ve tried other YouTube courses where I learned the basics but struggled to grow. However, there’s just something about Ali’s style and communication that made me completely rethink how I view YouTube.

[p]This course really helped me to think differently about creating a YouTube channel. It gave me a renewed energy to committing to creating content and uploading on a regular basis. As much as I have enjoyed the journey of creating content for YouTube previous to taking this course I definitely fell into the pitfall of creating goals outside my control. The biggest take away I got from this course was recognizing that I need to create actionable goals and focus on the things I have control over. If you’re on the fence about whether to take this course, DO IT!

[p]It got me going! I started Ali’s course 4 to 5 weeks ago, have uploaded five videos since in total over two channels. Then binned off one channel because I figured out what I wanted to post about. I’d set my expectations low on viewer numbers but have actually been humbled by the amount of folks who’ve seen the vids. I’m firmly committed to doing this for at least two years and aim for 4 vids a month! Thanks for getting me going!!!!!!!! Tremendous value!!!!!

[p]Thanks Ali & everyone in the team, this course is fantastic…I thought it might be lots of previously recorded videos stitched together but its not! Its hight quality content with a lot of effort, care and attention. thank you!

[p]Ali seems to know exactly what the novice YouTuber needs to hear and do to get started with a channel. He models design and communication strategies, then calls out these strategies in a step by step process that almost propels you into making a channel. The Part-Time YouTuber Academy has helped me launch a new literacy education project that I would never have known how to approach on my own. I would recommend this academy to anyone looking to create a decent and well-designed channel.

[p]A YouTube Channel can completely change your life –
[span]it changed mine.
[p]If we haven’t met before – hi, my name’s Ali 👋
[p]I started making YouTube videos in 2017, while in my final year of medical school at Cambridge University.
[p]I started off with
[strong]0 views, 0 subscribers and $0 in revenue.
[p]I knew absolutely nothing about filming, editing or publishing videos.
[p]But after watching
[strong]hundreds of tutorials on YouTube
[p], I figured out the basics.
[p]18 months later, my YouTube channel reached
[strong]100,000 subscribers
[p]and was making as much money as my full-time job working as a doctor.
[p]Two years later, I hit
[span]1 million subscribers, $1m in annual revenue,
[p]and finally made the decision to
[span]quit my day job.
[p]Now, I’ve been a Part-Time YouTuber for nearly 7 years, my channel’s grown to 6 million subscribers, I’ve written a New York Times best-selling book, made $6 million in revenue last year and I have a team of incredible creatives who work with me to create inspiring and educational content that helps people build a life they love.
[p]I genuinely look forward to Mondays doing what I love, with
[strong]freedom, fun and flexibility, and creating content that has a tangible impact on people.

[h2]The Simple “Secret” Formula to
[span]100,000+
[span]Subscribers
[p]So over the last 7 years, I’ve learned a lot about what it takes to
[strong]build an audience
[p]from scratch,
[strong]provide value
[p]consistently, and
[strong]monetize
[p]in a non-spammy way.
[p]I’ve spent
[strong]thousands of hours
[p], and over
[strong]$100,000 in courses and coaching programs
[p]to try and find the secret sauce that helps grow a channel and a business.
[p]And while
[strong]I’ve learned a hell of a lot of things
[p](more on that later), the biggest thing I’ve learned is this:
[strong]There’s no secret to building a life-changing YouTube channel.
[p]It’s just a matter of:
[strong]I personally guarantee
[p]that if you follow this formula,
[strong]your life will change in ways you can’t imagine.
[p]You’ll learn
[strong]incredibly useful skills
[p], you’ll make friends with amazing people from all over the world and you’ll start to generate ‘passive’ income. You might even get messages from people about how your videos have changed their lives 😳
[p]It seems simple in theory, but the execution is slightly more difficult.
[strong]Learn To Execute Flawlessly
[a]Join The Academy Today
[h2]So how do you succeed on YouTube without giving up all your spare time?
[h2]You build
[span]systems.
[p]That’s the secret.
[p]Walk into any McDonald’s, anywhere in the world and you’ll get the same service.
[p]And that’s mainly because McDonald’s have done a great job of systemising their business.
[p]The systems are so good that you get ridiculous volumes of ‘product’ in a ridiculously short time.
[p]Just like McDonald’s (and in fact, all other businesses), you want to build a
[strong]system
[p]around your YouTube channel, and wider content creation business.
[p]Systems provide leverage.
[p]Leverage is how you increase your output while saving time.
[p]That’s the
[strong]true secret
[p]to succeeding as a Part-Time YouTuber.
[h3]Build systems for:
[h4]Generating and researching ideas
[h4]Creating banger titles and thumbnails
[h4]Outsourcing, and monetising
[h4]Knowing what videos will perform well
[h4]Scripting, filming, and editing content
[h4]Publishing and repurposing
[h4]Reviewing  Your Analytics
[h4]And no – this won’t suck the creativity out of being a creator!
[p]This won’t suck the creativity out of being a creator.
[p]Instead, it
[strong]multiplies it
[p], because you’re spending your time focusing on the
[strong]creative
[p]parts that you
[strong]actually enjoy
[p].
[p]When you
[strong]systemise the living daylights
[p]out of your YouTube channel, and the wider business around it, you’re able to
[strong]maximally leverage your own time
[p].
[p]This means you can create
[strong]amazing videos
[p]without sacrificing large amounts of time.
[p]Of course, it still takes plenty of effort to make compelling YouTube videos.
[p]But if you’ve got a
[strong]system
[p], it takes a lot less time.

[h2]7 years of YouTube experience
[span]One immersive, self-paced course.
[p]Throughout my journey over the last 7 years, I’ve had constant questions from other creators asking about how I grew my own channel as a Part-Time YouTuber.
[p]So in 2020, I started the Part-Time YouTuber Academy as a way to
[strong]help creators invest their time into what really matters
[p]when it comes to being a Part-Time YouTuber –
[strong]building a system
[p].
[p]The systems we’ve developed and which we teach in the course grew my own channel from zero to
[strong]1.2 million subscribers
[p](with
[strong]$1,000,000
[p]in annual revenue) while working full-time as a doctor.
[p]And the systems I’ve continued to develop and use since then have grown my channel to
[strong]6 million subscribers
[p](with
[strong]$5,800,000
[p]in annual revenue). All while “working” under
[strong]10 hours per week
[p]on the channel.
[h2]As you’re working your way through the course, here’s a flavour of what you’ll get:
[h4]Niche Discovery Framework
[p]You’ll go through our
[strong]Niche Discovery Framework
[p], to help you

[p]creating content that’s unlikely to work for you in the long term.
[h4]Outsourcing
[h4]Almanack
[p]You’ll get my
[strong]Outsourcing Almanack
[p]– a system for
[strong]outsourcing editing

[strong]finding the perfect video editor
[p]who edits in your own style. This’ll help you save
[strong]10+ hours every single week.
[h4]Perfect Packaging Process
[p]You’ll learn my
[strong]Perfect Packaging Process
[p], a step-by-step framework (including
[strong]best practices, templates and tools
[p]) for creating compelling titles and thumbnails quickly and efficiently, so you’re not spending hours trying to craft the ‘perfect’ title and thumbnail combination every time.
[p]And so you’re not
[strong]wasting hours
[p]creating videos that no one’s going to click on because the title and thumbnail suck 😉
[h4]HIVES
[h4]Framework
[p]You’ll learn my
[strong]HIVES Framework

[strong]structuring and scripting

[h2]Frequently Asked Questions
[summary]Do I need to have a YouTube channel before I take the course?
[p]No, it’s not compulsory but we’re always going to recommend having a channel set up and being prepared to post videos so that you have the opportunity to implement what you’re learning from the course materials as you go.
[summary]What experience with YouTube do I need to have?
[p]No past experience with YouTube is required, you just need the desire to make YouTube part of your future.
[summary]Does this course teach me how to edit?
[p]Yes and no. You’ll get access to a free video class – ‘Video Editing with Final Cut Pro X – From Beginner to YouTuber’, as part of your purchase, but we don’t actually teach practical editing skills as part of the Part-Time YouTuber Academy curriculum itself.
[summary]What sort of channel is the course suitable for?
[p]The course isn’t tailored to any specific genre/style of video. That being said, educational channels (where the objective is to ‘educate’ rather than ‘entertain) are particularly ideal for this course. Still, if your videos try to provide value to your audience, the exact type of your channel won’t matter. In fact, I think the system and processes in the course can be applied to any genre of video and we’ll be on hand to help make sure that you feel able to apply these methods if you encounter any issues.
[summary]Should I wait until I have a certain number of subscribers?
[p]No. Over the last three years of teaching 3,000+ creators how to improve their YouTube game, we’ve taught a whole range of people from those with zero subscribers to channels with over 400k. This course is designed to help everyone move their channels forward regardless of what stage of the journey they’re at.
[summary]I’ve made 100 videos already, is this course for me?
[p]Of course 🙂 The course is aimed at creators of all abilities. Having 100 videos provides you with a really solid foundation to grow, monetise and scale your channel and we hope we can help you do that through the lessons on the course.
[summary]Will I get access to 1:1 support?
[p]We don’t offer 1:1 coaching as part of this course but you will get access to the PTYA Community where you can ask any questions you might have as you start your YouTube journey or get feedback from the community on your content 🙂
[summary]Is it possible to pay in instalments?
[p]Yes. We offer a 3 month payment plan on the Part-Time YouTuber Academy. To pay in instalments, select the payment plan at the checkout.

[p]Good luck – we can’t wait to hear from you!
[summary]I don’t need a full scholarship, is there an option to get a discount?
[p]Yes! We’ve been running scholarships for the last 3 years and we know that some people often don’t need full scholarships and might just need a little bit of help. In light of this, we’re rolling out a new scheme of discounted scholarships (detailed below). Just as a heads up, if you decide to apply for a full scholarship the standard is a little higher as we’re sure you can understand that those are harder for us to offer
[p]Full scholarship 👉 no payment needed
[p]25% off 👉 you pay $746
[p]50% off 👉 you pay $497
[p]75% off 👉 you pay $249

Please note spamming us with emails following up on your application will not increase your chances of receiving a scholarship 😋
[summary]My application video is 2 mins 5 seconds long, will this be accepted?
[p]No, we automatically disregard any applications over 2 mins.
[summary]Can I get feedback on my application?
[p]We review applications on an individual basis so we unfortunately can’t give feedback on unsuccessful applications at this time.
[summary]I haven’t got 3 videos published on my channel, can I still apply?
[p]You can still apply but it is very unlikely that your application will be successful over those who meet the criteria.
