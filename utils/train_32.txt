[h2]If You Are A Course Creator, You Might Be Affected By
[strong]“Commoditization”…
[p]What is
[em]commoditization
[p]and
[strong]how does it affect course creators?
[p]We will get to that in a minute, but first, you should know that…
[p]Affected creators
[strong]struggle
[span]with selling their course,
[strong]waste money
[span]on ads, and end up throwing in the towel
[p]For real…
[p]The problem is caused by
[strong]market
[p]saturation and
[span]sophistication
[span]Those are just fancy words that mean
[em]your prospects
[em]have seen it all
[p]Whether or not you like it,
[em]your course has to
[strong]compete
[em]with other courses, and even free YouTube videos
[p]for their
[span]attention and money.
[p]So when they see your offer… Most of them won’t take action immediately
[p]They may want to browse around for better deals and…
[em]If you have not played your cards well, and they find a similar and better-looking offering —
[strong]You’ve lost the sale!
[strong]This problem
[p]is known as
[span]commoditization.
[em]Listen.
[p]To
[strong]grab an infinite amount of sales
[p],
[em]decimate competitors
[p], and have the freedom to
[strong]name your price
[p]…
[p]You must
[em]pass your offers through a process
[p]I call…
[h2]De-Commoditization
[p]When you do this, the rewards are unmatched.
[p]For instance,
[em]you can compete with bigger players and
[span]still win
[p]You can
[em]skyrocket any product or brand to recognition
[strong]without
[em]being known
[p], having a following, or spending a fortune on ads!
[p]And soon enough I will be showing you
[em]the simple de-commoditization process for
[strong]taking a “Course” with loads of competitors and turning it into a “market-of-one”
[strong]Where the prospects see you as the only trusted maestro to teach them
[em]Even if they have never heard of you before
[p]A proper 1-of-1 (unicorn) kind of thing
[strong]I do this for every course I sell.
[p]And boy… what a
[em]difference
[p]it makes!
[p]Imagine for just one second how powerful that is
[p]Being able to
[em]create your own monopoly
[strong]…
[span]even if it’s for a few months before others jump on the bandwagon
[p]You would be set up to
[strong]make a boatload of sales
[p]But de-commoditization is not the only thing you need.
[em]You also need to…
[strong]Dramatize Your New Unicorn Offer
[div]Once you have a great offer, you need to
[em]demonstrate its value so effectively
[div]that
[strong]people can’t resist
[span]buying
[p]I am talking about
[span]evoking
[p]the feeling that they are truly seeing
[em]an “
[span]out-of-this-world” fantasy come alive
[strong]Think it’s difficult to create such a feeling?
[p]Well, It’s not.
[p]I do it.
[p]I am doing it right now.
[p]Which is why you’re still here reading this, even though you know it is a sales letter
[p]Well,
[strong]let me get to the point.
[p]This concept of dramatizing your offer is what some people call
[em]copywriting
[p], others say it’s
[em]messaging
[p]Honestly, I don’t care what you call it
[p]The only thing that matters to me …and hopefully to you is that…
[em]You can arrange the
[span]“right words”
[span]in the
[span]“right order”
[span]to tell a
[strong]compelling
[strong]story
[span]about
[strong]your offer
[span]Do that and you’d turn many prospects into buyers like clockwork
[p]You and I know that
[strong]it takes time
[strong]to master
[p]the art of
[strong]writing persuasive copy
[p]But not anymore.
[p]Because
[span]I know
[strong]a cool technique
[span]that can
[strong]help just about anyone
[span]put
[strong]pen on marketing paper
[span],
[em]powerfully…
[strong]It’s called… Permission Based Marketing
[p]Let’s call it PB marketing for short.
[p]One of the easiest ways to sell is through PB marketing
[p]In case you don’t know what that is, it is the type of marketing
[strong]where the buyer permits you to sell to them
[p]— directly or indirectly.
[p]Pay attention to this.
[p]It will make a difference in your online course business.
[p]When people allow you to sell to them,
[strong]they become more open-minded and are more likely to consider the merits of your offer.
[p]They let their guard down like a woman craving the man of her dreams
[p]Most times,
[strong]they decide they are buying whatever it is you’re selling
[p]before you even get the chance to make your pitch
[p]When you market this way,
[strong]people trust you 100x more
[span]And as a
[em]cool bonus
[span]you will also earn a ton of goodwill and respect from the people you market to
[p]So…
[p]What is the golden key —
[span]Permission based marketing
[p]—And
[strong]how can you use it to turn your sales around
[p]?
[h2]How Can You Use PB Marketing To Make A Ton Of Sales?
[p]To explain this… I want you to think about the average marketer
[p]Slimy. Tricky. Cunny. Full of lies. After your money
[p]In case you don’t already know,
[em]that’s the public perception of most marketers
[p]or adverts they encounter
[p]And if you’re honest with yourself, this isn’t far from the truth
[p]People
[em]have gotten used to being deceived and taken
[em]advantage of
[p]by “con men in marketers’ clothing”
[p]They now associate every marketer with this attitude
[p]It’s so dark that when they experience marketers with a slightly different “attitude”…
[strong]Their
[strong]affinity
[p]for them
[strong]increases
[p]greatly!
[p]This is why my sales messages are very believable and mighty persuasive
[p]Because…
[h2]They Sound Different
[p]For instance,
[em]Instead of putting up too good-to-be-true messages, I lead with education
[p]Rather than share intimidating bank account screenshots and pictures of me and my rolls royce —
[em]I share valuable materials that educate and inspire
[p]Instead of hiding the fact that I am trying to sell them,
[em]I’m upfront about it
[p]These are
[strong]exact opposites
[p]of what you have in the industry today
[p]Making me look very much like the special unicorn in the marketing community.
[p]There are
[span]two keywords
[strong]you should take out of this
[strong]and vow never to forget
[p]They are…
[h2]Transparency And Value
[p]That is
[em]what you want people to experience with every sales material you put out there
[p]Let people know you will present them with an offer at the end of the conversation but it’s okay to say NO and…
[p]You’re sure they will benefit from the interaction regardless.
[p]They won’t run away…
[p]In fact, they will be
[strong]more open to listening to you
[strong]and buying from you
[p]Without powerful sales messages like this, you can spend a gazillion dollars on ads with ZERO results to show for it
[p]Except for getting bald from the stress and pressure of not making sales
[p]But once you nail down a pretty good PB copy
[strong]You are ready for the third and final phase
[p]of the process
[p]Which is to…
[strong]Get The Right People To Read The Message (Lots of Them)
[p]Once you’ve designed your
[span]de-commoditized offer
[p], and
[span]crafted your PB sales copy
[p]The only thing you have to do now is to
[strong]get it in front of buyers
[p]Now,
[strong]your buyers are not every—TOM
[em]who wants your product
[p]The
[strong]right audience
[p]must meet
[span]three (3)
[p]criteria
[strong]They are those who:
[span]Want
[li]your stuff
[li]Can
[span]Afford
[li]it, and…
[li]Have the
[span]Authority
[li]to make the purchase decision
[p]I think that’s pretty self-explanatory
[p]But here’s an illustration:
[em]Many people WANT a Ferrari but very few of those people can AFFORD it and even fewer will have the authority to make the call
[p]It’s the same for any product, service or as in your case—online course
[p]The big question is…
[h2]How Do We Attract The Right Traffic To Our Product?
[p]Well, that’s where paid ads come in
[p]But not in the way you’re thinking
[p]We are
[strong]NOT
[p]going to be selling your course with these ads
[p]Or do some crazy ninja super narrow targeting sh*t the gurus are telling you to do
[p]The type of ads we use are just like I.V. cards
[p]Yes, an invitation card
[p]Its only job is to
[strong]pique
[span]the
[strong]curiosity
[span]of the
[strong]RIGHT
[strong]audience
[p]and
[strong]invite them
[p]to view your sales copy
[p]And there are
[strong]simple techniques
[p]for doing this for any product quickly
[h2]Here’s An Example
[p]While I would love to explain all the tiny little details about this example, this is piece is already getting too long
[p]What I want you to know is that…
[strong]Simple ads like this combined with PB-style sales pages are money multipliers
[p]The one in the example above was a
[strong]4X multiplier
[p]while it ran
[span]Bringing in $400
[p]for every $100 spent on ads
[h2]To Sell Thousands Of Any Course, You Need To…
[strong](1) De-commoditize:
[p]Make your offer stand out from the crowd and free YouTube by positioning it a few steps back (We’ll talk about this later)
[strong](2) Use Permission Based Marketing:
[p]Employ subtle persuasion techniques that leave people feeling great whether they buy or not (…this makes people trust you and buy)
[strong](3) Attract Qualified Buyers Using IV Ads:
[p]Your buyers are lost in a void of unqualified low-quality traffic. IV ads help bring them to the surface and pre-frame them to be persuaded by your PB-style copy
[i]Now listen.
[p]This is
[strong]the
[span]EXACT
[strong]same process
[p]I have used to
[strong]make a ton of money
[strong]selling multiple courses over the years.
[em]For instance, last year I promoted a product titled
[strong]Meta Ads Creative Hack, for many months and…
[h2]Here’s What Sales From That Campaign Looked Like
[h2]And Another One…
[h2]Here’s One More For The Bookies…
[span]So, as you can see… the course selling business can be
[strong]very lucrative
[strong]if you ramp up your sales volume
[p]Most course creators don’t know how to do this,
[strong]especially without wasting tons of money on ad tests
[p]And so…
[p]— They follow popular advice on the internet
[p]— Position their offers wrongly, attract a bunch of unqualified visitors and leads
[p]— And then wonder
[em]why they never convert…
[em]…Even for courses that others seem to be selling very easily.
[p]Listen, my friend,
[strong]you don’t have a product problem
[strong]There is likely nothing wrong with your website
[p]What you have is…
[em]A commoditized offer, faulty ads and poor sales message
[p]I suffered inexplicable difficulty when I started because of this.
[p]Little to zero sales. Wasted ad budgets. Etc.
[p]Until I got to the root of the matter.
[em]It took me months of trial and error and scouring through high-ticket courses to finally figure out a solution…
[p]I have now
[em]sifted through all the paid courses
[p],
[em]taken
[strong]the best lessons from
[strong]my experiments
[p], and condensed them into a video course, titled…
[h2]Course Creators Guide To Selling Over 1,000 Courses

[strong]Frequently Asked Questions
[strong]Is this a SCAM?
[p]Good question. Because it’s difficult to know who to trust on the internet these days. Unlike most “gurus” I make my money from selling courses not just teaching people how to do the same. I’m sure you know this isn’t – if not you won’t have read this far but just to silence any doubt that may arise – here is
[a]the link
[p]to our student portal (Yes, the one you get access to immediately after your payment)
[strong]Is there a Guarantee?
[p]Yep… this product has a 30-day guarantee.
[p]If after going through the course you don’t find that it is as described, just let us know and we’ll give you your money back.
[strong]No questions asked.
[p]We obviously don’t think it’ll come to that, but if you’re even the least bit worried if this will work for you, then put your mind at ease.
[strong]How Do I Get This Video Course?
[p]This is “On-demand” content that you can access at any time.
[p]Once your payment is submitted, you will receive an email with your login details in 15 seconds where you’ll be able to access the entire video course content
[strong]How Does The Course Pay For It Self?
[p]The truth is that if you keep trying to sell your course the way you’re doing now, you could WASTE as much as the cost of this course in unprofitable ads. Using a proven system will save you months and even years of trial and error (time you will never get back once it’s gone). This is a no-brainer deal.
