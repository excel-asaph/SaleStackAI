[h1]I Will Make You a Pro Editor With a Certificate in just 10 Days
[p]Using Only Your Smartphone and CapCut (No Laptop. No Experience. No          Stress.)
[div]2000+ Trained | Only 30 Slots Left | ₦5,000 today only |          Price increases in 45 Minutes
[h2]Let Me Guess What's Been Happening...
[p]You've tried learning video editing from YouTube tutorials. You've          downloaded CapCut three times. You've watched "beginner-friendly"          courses that left you more confused than when you started.
[p]And each time, you end up stuck, frustrated, and back to square one —          still not knowing how to actually edit a video that looks          professional.
[span]The problem isn't you. It's how these "courses" are            structured.
[p]They teach you tools and features in isolation. "Here's how to add a          transition." "Here's how to adjust colors." But they never show you          how to actually create a complete video from start to finish that          you'd be proud to post or show a client.
[p]That changes today.
[h3]My name is Phily, and I wasn't always a professional video editor...
[p]Three years ago, I was broke — literally. ₦1,200 in my account. Zero            job prospects. Zero connections in the online business space. Just            desperation and a smartphone.
[p]That phone became my saving grace. I discovered smartphone video            editing and gave it my all. No fancy camera. No MacBook. Just free            apps, free resources, and relentless practice.
[span]In less than 4 weeks, I landed my first paying client.
[p]That job pushed me to refine my skills even more. I repeated the            process, improving with each project, and before I knew it, I was            earning six figures a month.
[p]Today? I earn over 7 figures monthly from smartphone video editing            alone. I've worked with coaches, brands, digital creators, affiliate            marketers, and small businesses who need video content to grow.
[span]This system works.
[p]I've made all the            mistakes, so you don't have to. The blueprints, scripts, and            guidelines have been tried and tested — on me first, then on over            2000+ people who've succeeded with them.
[h3]This Isn't Another "Watch and Wish" Course
[p]It's a 10-Day Transformation System Where You Create Real Portfolio          Pieces Every Single Day
[p]Most courses teach you features. This course makes you
[span]create finished videos
[p]that prove you can          actually edit. By Day 10, you'll have a portfolio of 10 professional          videos and undeniable proof of your growth.
[h2]Here's Your Exact 10-Day Transformation Journey:
[h4]Day 1: The Scroll-Stopper Reel
[p]You'll create your first 15-second Reel that stops people            mid-scroll. Learn cuts, timing, text overlays, and how to sync            everything to music beats. Finish the day with a video you can            actually post.
[h4]Day 2: The Transformation Video
[p]Master the before/after format that gets massive engagement. Learn            split screens, colour matching, and how to make any footage look            cohesive. Create a transformation video in your niche.
[h4]Day 3: The Product Showcase
[p]Make ANY product look expensive with keyframe animations, smooth            transitions, and strategic music selection. Even if you're filming a            coffee mug, it'll look like a brand paid for this video.
[h4]Day 4: The YouTube Video Intro.
[p]Create a 30-45 second branded intro for YouTube that makes your            channel look established. Learn text animations, logo reveals, and            how to export for different platforms.
[h4]Day 5: The Talking Head Video
[p]Edit a 1-2 minute talking head video that looks and sounds            professional. Master jump cuts, auto-captions, B-roll integration,            and audio cleanup. This is the foundation for YouTube, testimonials,            and client work.
[h4]Day 6: The Cinematic Product Ad
[p]Learn colour grading to create mood and masking for impossible            effects. Create a 30-second ad that looks like it cost thousands to            produce. This is where your work becomes art.
[h4]Day 7: The Fast-Paced Tutorial
[p]Create quick tutorial content that performs well on Reels and            TikTok. Master speed ramping, dynamic text, and how to make            educational content feel entertaining instead of boring.
[h4]Day 8: Portfolio Project (Your Choice)
[p]Choose between three professional portfolio pieces: a brand story            video, a high-energy promo, or an elevated tutorial. Apply            everything you've learned to create work you'd show clients.
[h4]Day 9: Your Signature Style Video.
[p]Create a video for YOUR brand or business. Discover what makes your            editing style uniquely yours. This is the piece that represents you            professionally.
[h4]Day 10: Transformation Proof.
[p]Recreate your Day 1 video with everything you know now. The            difference will be SHOCKING. Create a before/after comparison video            that proves your transformation and becomes your best marketing            tool.

[h2]Why This Works When Other Courses Don't
[p]You Create, Not Just Watch.
[p]Every day you finish with a complete video, you can post or show            clients. No theory-only lessons. No "we'll apply this later." You're            creating real work from Day 1.
[p]Built for Smartphones Using CapCut
[p]Every technique is designed specifically for mobile editing. No            "this only works on desktop" disappointments. Everything is            optimised for the tools you already have.
[p]Progression Projects Show Growth
[p]You'll edit similar content on Day 1 vs Day 10 to SEE your            improvement. This visible growth isn't just motivating — it's proof            you can show others.
[p]Learn by Doing, Not Memorizing.
[p]Skills are taught in context as you need them for each project.            You'll never learn a technique and wonder, "When would I actually            use this?"
[p]Daily Milestones Build Confidence
[p]Each day unlocks a new capability. By Day 5, you're already creating            client-worthy work. By Day 10, you have a complete portfolio.
[h3]Real Results From Real People
[p]"Within 72 hours, I edited my first video, shared it on my status,              and someone asked me for a rate. I charged ₦7K and got paid              immediately."
[p]— Tochi A.
[p]"As a student, I now make enough to pay for books and food by              editing short videos for small businesses. This course changed              everything."
[p]— Rose E., University Student
[p]"I didn't even finish the course before I got my first gig.              Someone saw a Day 4 project I posted and hired me on the spot."
[p]— Henry I.
[p]"From zero editing skills to ₦65K/month using only my Infinix              phone. The day-by-day structure made it impossible to get lost or              overwhelmed."
[p]— Doyin T.
[p]"I was running a small business and paying editors ₦20K per video.              Now I edit my own content AND offer editing to other businesses.              Two income streams from one skill."
[p]— Blessing M., Business Owner
[p]"I used the client scripts provided and closed 3 clients in one              week. This isn't theory — it's a complete system."
[p]— Emmanuel J.
[p]"Started this while job hunting after graduation. Now I make more              from editing than from the job I was searching for. Glad I learned              this skill."
[p]— Sarah K.
[h2]Note for Students:
[p]This is actually the PERFECT time for you to learn this skill. Here's          why:
[li]You have flexible time - Between classes and breaks, you can            dedicate 2 hours daily
[li]Start earning immediately - Don't wait until after graduation to            have income
[li]Graduate with a portfolio - Most graduates have zero proof of            skills. You'll have 10 videos.
[li]Reduce financial dependence - Stop asking for money. Start sending            it.
[li]Job security insurance - If the job market disappoints, you have a            backup income stream
[p]Several students started this course at 300 level and graduated,          already earning ₦50K-₦100K monthly from editing. They entered the job          market with negotiating power or simply chose to stay independent.
[p]The question isn't "should I wait until after school?" It's "why would          I wait when I could be earning NOW?"
[h3]This Program Is NOT For You If:
[p]You want to "learn someday" but won't commit 2 hours daily for 10            days
[p]You expect results without actually creating the daily projects
[p]You're looking for a "get rich quick" scheme with zero effort
[p]You want advanced Hollywood-level effects (this is practical            smartphone editing)
[p]You prefer complaining over learning
[p]If you want to grow and you're willing to show up daily, you're            welcome here. If you want to whine and make excuses, this isn't for            you.

[h2]How This Works (It's Ridiculously Simple)
[h3]Step 1: Enroll Today at ₦5,000
[p]Click the button, complete payment, and you'll immediately be            redirected to a Thank You page with your access link.
[h3]Step 2: Join the Private Community
[p]You'll receive a confirmation email with login details and the            Telegram group link where 2000+ students are actively learning and            winning.
[h3]Step 3: Start Day 1 Immediately
[p]Log in and begin your first project. Within 2 hours, you'll have            created your first professional-looking video. No delays. No            confusion.
[h3]Step 4: Show Up Daily for 10 Days
[p]Dedicate 2 hours per day to complete each day's project. Follow the            guided tutorials, personalise the projects, and watch your skills            compound.
[h3]Step 5: Graduate With a Portfolio
[p]On Day 10, you'll have 10 finished videos spanning multiple styles,            plus a powerful before/after comparison that proves your            transformation. Use this portfolio to land clients or build your            audience immediately.
[p]PS: Some people start getting client inquiries within 72 hours of          posting their Day 2 or 3 projects.
[h3]My Personal Promise to You
[p]If you show up for all 10 days, complete every project, and can            honestly say you didn't learn anything valuable, I'll personally            review your work and give you additional one-on-one coaching until            you succeed.
[p]That's how confident I am that this works.
[p]But here's the thing: you have to actually do the work. This isn't            passive learning. You can't watch the videos and hope skills            magically appear. You have to create the projects.
[p]If you do that, transformation is inevitable.
[h2]Questions You Might Be Asking...!
[h4]I've never edited a video before. Will I actually be able to do                this?
[p]Yes. This training is designed for absolute beginners. Every                technique is explained step-by-step, and you create alongside                me. If you can use Instagram, you can do this.
[h4]Do I need a specific phone or expensive equipment?
[p]A: No. Any smartphone with CapCut installed works. Students have              succeeded with phones as basic as Infinix and Tecno. If your phone              can record video and run CapCut, you're good.
[h4]What if I can't dedicate 2 hours every single day?
[p]A: The 10-day structure is recommended for maximum momentum and              transformation, but you have lifetime access. Go at your own pace.              Just know that the faster you complete it, the faster you can              start earning.
[h4]I'm currently in school. Is this realistic with my schedule?
[p]A: Absolutely. Many of our successful students learned this while              in school. 2 hours daily is less than you probably spend on social              media. Do it between classes, in the evenings, or on weekends.              Several students started earning before graduation by learning              this skill early.
[h4]Will this actually help me get clients?
[p]A: Yes. You're getting both the editing skills AND the              client-getting system. The 50+ pitch scripts, pricing strategies,              and portfolio pieces give you everything you need to start landing              paid work immediately.
[h4]How is this different from just watching YouTube tutorials?
[p]A: YouTube teaches random techniques with no structure. This is a              complete transformation system where you build real portfolio              pieces daily. You're not just learning — you're creating proof of              your skills.
[h4]What if I get stuck or have questions?
[p]A: You're joining a private Telegram community with 2000+ active              members and direct access to support. You'll never be stuck              wondering what to do next.
[h4]Is CapCut really powerful enough for professional work?
[p]A: Absolutely. I earn 7 figures monthly using primarily smartphone              editing. CapCut has the same core features as desktop software —              keyframes, color grading, masking, speed ramping. It's not about              the tool; it's about knowing how to use it.
[h4]Why is the price so low compared to other courses?
[p]A: Because I remember being broke with ₦1,200 in my account. I              want this accessible to students, side hustlers, and anyone hungry              to change their situation. I make my real money from client work,              not gatekeeping knowledge.
[h4]What happens after the 10 days?
[p]A: You'll have lifetime access to review lessons, the 50 practice              project ideas to keep growing, and the community for ongoing              support. Plus, all future updates are free. This isn't a 10-day              thing — it's a foundation for a long-term skill.
[h4]Can I really make ₦50K/week from this?
[p]A: Many people are. Product showcase videos go for ₦5K-₦10K.              Talking head edits for coaches go for ₦8K-₦15K. Instagram Reels              packages go for ₦20K-₦30K. Five clients at ₦10K each = ₦50K/week.              The demand is there; you just need the skills and the system.
[h4]I'm not tech-savvy. Will I struggle with this?
[p]A: If you can send a WhatsApp message and scroll through              Instagram, you can do this. Everything is explained assuming              you're a complete beginner. No technical jargon. No assumptions              about what you already know.
[h2]You Have Three Options Right Now
[h3]Option 1: Do Nothing
[p]Keep watching YouTube tutorials that lead nowhere. Stay              frustrated. Stay stuck. Six months from now, you're in the same              place, still wishing you knew how to edit.
[h3]Option 2: Try to Figure It Out
[p]Spend months piecing together random information, making the same              mistakes I made, getting inconsistent results. Eventually learn              through trial and error, but waste valuable time and miss              opportunities.
[h3]Option 3: Take the Proven Path Invest
[p]₦5,000 today. Follow the 10-day system. Create 10 portfolio              pieces. Graduate with proof you can edit professionally. Start              landing clients or building your audience immediately.
[p]A phone + this skill = freedom.
[p]No laptop? No problem. No experience? We'll teach you. No            confidence? We'll build it.
[p]The only thing you need to bring is the decision to start.
[p]Price increases to ₦10,000 in 45 minutes
[p]Only 30 slots left at current price
[p]Fast action bonuses expire after 30 enrollments
[h2]Join 2000+ People Who Made the Decision
[p]"Best ₦5K I ever spent. Now I charge ₦5K per 15-second Reel and              edit 5-7 per week. Do the math." — Blessing M.
[p]"I was sceptical because of the low price. Thought it would be              basic. But this is the most structured, practical course I've              taken. The daily projects are genius." — Chidi O.
[p]"Day 6 changed my life. Learning colour grading unlocked a whole              new level. Clients specifically ask for my 'cinematic style' now."              — Sarah K.
[p]"I finish my editing gigs faster than people with laptops because              I can edit anywhere — on the bus, during lunch break, before bed.              Smartphone editing is underrated." — David A.
[p]"Started learning this while job hunting. Ended up making more              from editing than the salary I was hoping for. Best backup plan              that became my main plan." — Michael T.
[div]REMINDER: 2000+ people already transformed. 30 slots left at          ₦5,000. Price increases in 45 Minutes.
[h2]Here's What I Know About You...
[p]You're reading this because something inside you knows you're capable          of more. You see content creators, small businesses, and brands making          money from video content, and you think, "I could do that."
[p]You're right. You could.
[p]The only difference between you and someone already earning from          editing is that they made a decision and followed through. They          weren't smarter. They didn't have better resources. They just started          and stayed consistent.
[p]This is your moment to make that same decision.
[p]Ten days from now, you could have a portfolio of professional videos.          You could have the skills to charge ₦5K, ₦10K, ₦15K per project. You          could have the confidence to pitch clients or build an audience.
[p]Or ten days from now, you could still be watching random tutorials,          still feeling stuck, still wishing you knew how to edit.
[p]The difference between those two futures is the decision you make          right now.
[span]P.S.
[p]— While you're reading this, three more          people just enrolled and started their Day 1 projects. The community          is growing. The momentum is building. The only question is: Will you          be part of the next wave of success stories, or will you watch from          the sidelines?
[span]P.P.S.
[p]— Remember, you're not just buying a          course. You're buying back your time, your confidence, and your          financial freedom. ₦5,000 is less than what you'd spend on data and          food in a week. But the skill you gain lasts a lifetime and can earn          you multiples of that investment every single week.
