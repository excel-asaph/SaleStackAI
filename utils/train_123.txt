[h2]Your Lighting Kit Explained
[p]Your lighting kit doesn’t need to be complicated or expensive.  Here we talk about the putting together a simple portrait lighting kit. We then go on to talk about how to set up your flash on your stand with a convertible umbrella and flash trigger.
[h2]Four Ways to Trigger Your Flash
[p]Here we show you four easy ways to trigger your flash. We break down how easy it is to trigger your flash and explain which options you can use in different situations.  The best part is there is an option that will work with any flash you may have.
[h2]Flash to Subject Distance
[p]Here we demonstrate what happens when you change the distance of your flash to your subject, while keeping all of your camera and flash settings the same. We'll also demonstrate how that works with Adam shooting portraits of Jared while he moves the flash different distances from Jared.
[h2]Flash to Background Distance
[p]In this section, we demonstrate how easy you can change the color of your background by moving closer or away from a wall with your subject and your flash.
[h2]How Shutter Speed Effects Ambient Light
[p]Shutter speed directly affects Ambient Light in Flash Photography. Remember that.  It’s probably one of the most important things to know when shooting with Flash
[h2]Aperture Demonstration - Shooting into the Sun
[p]With an open Aperture (lower number) you’re letting in a lot of light.  Closed Aperture (smaller number) you’re restricting the amount of light.
[h2]Understanding the Flash Zoom Head
[p]Most of your flashes have a zoom head meaning that you can manually move the flash tube either closer or farther away from the the lens in your flash.
[h2]Quality of Light
[p]This part of the guide focuses on the Quality of the light meaning how you can change the look of the light generated by your flash by using a modifier like an umbrella. An umbrella will serve to give you a smoother, softer light with nice shape as compared to a bare flash head which will give you a harder, more contrasty light.

[h2]Steam Owner Portrait Shoot
[p]In this section, we show you how to shoot environmental portraits using one off-camera flash with an umbrella in a restaurant.  Environmental Portraits are when you are specifically shooting your subject in a particular location to tie them and the location in to each other.
[h2]Studio Portrait without a Studio
[p]In this shoot, we show what happens when you’re on a shoot and have to overcome a serious challenge.  We are tasked to shoot studio-quality headshots but we don’t have studio, seamless backdrop or even a white wall.
[h2]Manager Environmental Portrait
[p]Now that we’ve done headshots with Maria, we shoot Environmental Portraits of her tending bar.  While we want the bar to look good for context, we really want Maria to look great, so we show you how we get an ambient exposure of the bar and then light Maria with one off-camera flash.
[h2]The FULL Elvis Room Shoot
[p]In this shoot we show you how to build your exposure balancing Ambient light.  This is a really great progression where we go thru so many options for lighting a subject with one flash and improvising with our surroundings.
[h2]In the Kitchen: Fridge Shot
[p]This shoot is all about getting creative with flash.  To prepare for this shoot, we developed a story behind our shoot and creatively used our environment to light our subject.  We talk about pre-visualizing our shoots, and in this shoot we take things one step further by creating a story line.
[h2]Ping Pong Shoot
[p]We get creative in this shoot with a super-inexpensive lighting modifier that totally gets the job done!  This is another example of how you need to always think on your feet and adapt to your surroundings and available resources to get your shot.

[h1]Real User Reviews
[p]"Pick up this video and take your photography to the next level…"
[p]Jared Polin knocks it out of the park in his new Beginner Flash Guide video!  He and veteran studio photographer Adam Lerner basically teach you to not be afraid of your flash.  Anyone can mount a speedlight to the hotshoe on a DSLR, but your portraits begin to take on a more professional look when you can take that speedlight off the camera and experiment with postion, power, and exposure settings.  Jared and Adam teach you that you can accomplish this with a minimum of inexpensive gear and a few basic lighting rules.
[p]The information is presented very professionally in easy-to-digest sections that are broken up by short “Just the Tips” segments that contain a lot of useful information.  They do several in-studio shoots as well as go on-location for environmental portraits.  I love it when these two photographers team up because they compliment each other so well.  In this video, the viewer gets a nice combination of Adam’s no-nonsense technical approach and Jared’s flair for the artistic view and out-of-the-box thinking.  This video is essential for photographers just starting out who want to experiment with lighting, while being extremely useful for experienced photographers who want to refine their technique.
[p]Like all of the Fro Knows Photo videos, this one is a lot of fun to watch.  We’ve all seen Jared dance several times before, but this video is worth the price just to see Adam do the “Flash Dance.”  Pick up this video and take your photography to the next level.

[p]"I would have never had the confidence without this video flash guide…"
[p]Off camera flash. Oh man! I was always put off by the fear of not knowing what to do. So, I considered myself a " natural light" photographer. Well, that's one way to put yourself into a box and have all your images look like everyone else's. I thought to myself what if I learned and understood off camera flash! Could I begin to separate myself from the pack. My options to educate myself led me to Jared and Adam. I must say that the two of them work very well in the flash guide. They begin with the basics and branch out from there. I quickly started to emulate what Jared and Adam were teaching. Low and behold, it wasn't as scary or hard as I previously thought. I am happy to have purchased 2 speed lights with triggers since watching. I would have never had the confidence without this video flash guide.
[p]If you were to invest in one educational product this year. Make the video flash guide the one. It will push you into your next level of photography.

[p]"Adam and Jared broke it down so anyone can understand the concepts. It is cause …"
[p]Jared and Adam have put together the perfect beginner guide for using flash. It has really allowed me to take my photography to the next level.
[p]I have watched YouTube videos and attended a flash basic class at a local shop but still didn’t really understand how to use my SB900 flash. I was overwhelmed by all the different settings and factors that come into play. I would try to make too many changes at once and get frustrated. I didn’t know how to achieve the results I was looking for. Everything was blown out our just had bad shadows.
[p]After watching the beginner flash guide I now “get it”.  I understand how to approach a shoot and how to make changes one at a time as needed. Adam and Jared show you real life demonstrations on real life shoots. I watched the video in its entirety and went back with my own equipment set up to practice the techniques being demonstrated.
[p]The best part is this isn’t hard and complicated.  Adam and Jared broke it down so anyone can understand the concepts. It is cause and effect and making one adjustment at a time.  You don’t have to spend a lot of money to get started improving your photography either. I picked up a great used flash, that I now know how to use and an umbrella and stand and I’m ready to go.
[p]Thank you Adam and Jared for putting together a comprehensive guide that even I can understand. Using off camera flash really takes things to the next level. Before this guide I had the right equipment but didn’t understand what I was doing.
[p]Thanks!

[p]"There are so many parts about it that I loved. The Fro Quick Tips. Positioning tips…"
[p]Jared, I love the flash guide. As I have said before you and Adam are a great team and are amazing teachers together. There are so many parts about it that I loved. The Fro Quick Tips. Positioning tips instead of fighting the settings in your camera. Changing the flash power. You and Adam by walking through all these things just make everything make sense. I finally understand the settings menu in my flash. I always hatted using it, to harsh or could not tell it was even on. Now that I know an easy start up kit that will give me a way to get the most out of using my flash I can't wait to get started building my flash kit. i am looking forward to working on my indoor shots and getting softer outdoor shots. Thank you for letting me preview the Flash Guide. I will be getting one for sure. Thank Adam for me too. Love

[p]"You showed me that you don’t need a top of the line camera and lenses to get great…"
[p]I learned so much from this video.  I  thought flash photography was going to be complicated, but you and Adam broke everything down and made it very simple for me.  Everything was step by step.  I didn't realize how little equipment I needed to start out.  You showed me that you don't need a top of the line camera and lenses to get great pictures.  The first hour of the video was very informative.  Learned about exposure/aperture/lighting/flash power and what is affected when each is changed.
[p]I liked that it wasn't just a regular, boring tutorial.  It had some of that Fro Flare!!  Just The Tips were a great tool to break up the other segments.

[p]"I was pretty surprised at how quickly it started making sense once I purchased…"
[p]i bought a nikon speedlight a few years ago, thinking i'd be able to go outside and shoot some moody backlight shots right off the bat. i was way wrong. i was quickly so confused at mixing light sources that i pretty much gave up, except for occasionally throwing it on my camera and bouncing the light off the ceiling at parties. i was pretty bummed... not to mention a few bucks short and left with a little less space in my bag.
[p]I was pretty surprised at how quickly it started making sense once I purchased this guide I really had a solid understanding of how i can start with my ambient lighting, get the exposure i wanted, and add my flash in later without blowing my settings out of the water. i think i counted 4 or 5 "a-ha! moments" before i was through the 3-hour guide.
