[span]Years ago
[strong],
[p]did you dream of waking up every morning to a screaming alarm, hitting the snooze button, scrolling Instagram to see a few beach photos (“That would be nice…someday…”), then stumbling out of bed, gulping down some coffee, and rushing out the door?
[p]And not just once or twice. Every day. Every week. Every year.
[strong]For decades.
[p]When did we
[i]accept
[p]a life that looks like this?
[p]Tired, underappreciated, resigned to the same old schedule…because “that’s just how it is.” Stuck in your own head with no good role models to look to.
[p]And if you ever complain, you get this old chestnut: “You should be lucky to just have a job.”
[p]And that’s life: A 9-5 job, Netflix at night, weekend trips to Home Depot to buy some new shelves, and endless scrolling on Instagram to see photos of places we’ll never visit.
[b]For the rest of your life.
[h2]What if your life was different?
[b]Imagine a different kind of Monday morning.
[p]You wake up as the sun streams through your window at 9:15am — no alarm clock — and roll over to check your phone.
[p]You scroll through Instagram for a few minutes, loving the travel photos. You know you’ll be on a beach 3 weeks from now.
[p]You get up, make a pot of hot coffee, and cue up your favorite podcast to listen to as you step outside to take your dog on a walk. No rush this morning — a leisurely walk is your new guilt-free morning ritual.
[p]When you get home, you pour another cup of hot coffee. You take a sip and look at your email. What do you see?
[p]You’ve received 13 orders
[i]while you were sleeping
[p]. $6,500 in total. It’s hard to believe you made this much from something you created a year ago.
[b]You’ve built an asset that pays you to live.
[p]Your phone buzzes. You smile. It’s not a boss calling you — it’s another order.
[b]Another $500 in your bank account — automatically.
[i]These are actual sales from my business that came in while I was sleeping.
[i]Take a 2-hour lunch on a weekday (above, a spontaneous weekday lunch at 3pm)
[p]You’re deep in work and you lose all track of time. And then, just after noon, a friend texts you to see if you want to grab lunch. “Sure,” you say — and because you set your own hours, you make it a 2-hour lunch.
[p]After you get home, your calendar reminds you that you have a 30-minute consulting call with a client. These days, you don’t do a lot of consulting, but you’ve scaled up over the past few weeks to pay for a 3-week luxury vacation you’re planning to take in a few months.
[p]Instead of squeezing in one rushed vacation a year to fit your limited PTO, now you take 3-4 leisurely trips every year. You splurge on one of them by inviting your family and paying for everything.
[p]You spend more time on your health, too.
[p]On your way home from the gym — something else you never used to have time for — you pass one of your favorite shops. You spot something that would make a great gift for a friend of yours. It’s not their birthday, but you buy it anyway.
[p]You can afford it, guilt-free.
[span]While you were buying that gift, another two sales came in.
[i]Taken at 4:15pm on a Tuesday
[p]6 months ago, you were surrounded by the usual advice to cut back on $3 coffees. Today, you’ve designed your Rich Life – and you’re living it, too!
[b]You can live the life you want. I’ll show you proof — with real numbers.
[p]While other people worry about saving $3 here and $5 there, a small group of people have decided to live different lives. And there’s a growing wave of people who enjoy lives like this every day. You won’t see them in the ALL-CAPS headlines about the economy or millennials.
[p]But they’re quietly earning great money, building flexible lives, and sharing their passions with the world.
[strong]I know, because I’m one of them.
[p]Hi, I’m Ramit Sethi.
[p]You might know me as the author of the New York Times bestseller
[i]I Will Teach You To Be Rich
[p].
[p]Or you might have seen me in a 6-page Fortune profile, featured in Forbes next to Warren Buffett, or as a regular guest on the Tim Ferriss Podcast.
[i]Me in Times Square with my new book, Fortune Magazine, next to Warren Buffett in Forbes, and on the Tim Ferriss podcast
[h2]I should be working in a cubicle wearing an oversized Cisco t-shirt
[p]If you’re wondering what the catch is, let’s just cut the shit right now.
[p]I hate when some random internet guy tells you:
[i]“It’s so simple to be a millionaire! Just follow my system…”
[p]…and then, buried halfway down the page, they casually mention that their parents gave them a “small loan” of $989,000. Thanks, dude.
[p]I didn’t grow up with rich parents. My mom and dad immigrated from India. My dad was an engineer and my mom stayed home raising 4 kids. No nanny, no private schools.
[p]My mom made dinner at home every night. We ate out about once a month, usually at a pizza place where we had a coupon.
[p]Our family vacation involved driving to Southern California and staying with family. My mom packed lunches for the trip to save money.
[p]And honestly — I was lucky! I was lucky enough to be born in America with two parents who taught me the value of education and working hard.
[p]In my 20s, I asked my parents how they raised 4 kids on one income. My mom told me that once, when we were enrolling in a kids’ soccer league, the fees were too high. She called them and asked if there was any way they could waive the fees. They told her if she came and chalked the fields before a game, they would waive it. So that’s what my mom did.
[p]Imagine learning that your mom was chalking a soccer field so you could play soccer as a kid. My parents taught me the value of hard work. They taught me that there’s
[b]always a way.
[p]When it was time to apply to college, they told me I needed to get scholarships to pay for it. I decided I was going all-in: I built a system to apply to 65 scholarships. The scholarships I got ended up paying my way through undergrad and grad school at Stanford.
[p]In college, I started to realize that even if you get a degree, it’s easy to fall into the trap of the default American lifestyle:
[span]Get a job and work 9-5 for 45 years, hating my alarm clock every morning
[span]Buy a bunch of useless trinkets for my living room to keep up with the Joneses
[span]Wake up when your boss tells you to, do the work your boss tells you to, and take a limited vacation when your boss lets you
[p]NO! I refused to get on that hamster wheel.
[p]A lifetime of struggle — of feeling guilty about a $10 appetizer — with nothing to show for it.
[p]Of accepting whatever handouts the world gave me. Of shrinking my world and convincing myself that spending $10 on an extra dessert was what would really make me happy.
[p]No.
[b]I wanted more.
[p]And I was willing to work to get it.
[p]If I’d followed my default life path, I’d be an engineer at a tech company, wearing an oversized t-shirt with a huge Cisco logo. Not a bad life — but not for me.
[p]No thanks.
[p]I wanted to craft a life that let me work on my own terms.
[p]I didn’t know
[i]how
[p]to do it. I just knew I wanted to figure it out, somehow.
[p]With a bit of luck and hard work — and some very specific decisions that I want to show you — I was able to craft a totally different life.
[p]My Rich Life.
[p]I went from a college student with no experience to founder and CEO of a successful, automated, multimillion-dollar business that’s helped millions of people.
[p]A
[strong]business
[p]that lets me go to the gym in the middle of the day. Or take every Wednesday off just to read.
[p]A
[strong]business
[p]that lets me share my passions and experiences with the world — and still be myself.
[p]A
[strong]business
[p]that lets me create the lifestyle I want — and actually generates revenue while I’m traveling (and even sleeping).
[p]A
[strong]business
[p]that gives me enough money that I never have to worry about buying appetizers or a nice outfit or going all-in on a fancy wedding and 6-week honeymoon.
[p]A
[strong]business
[p]that gives me the freedom to say “YES!” to the things I love (and a guilt-free “no” to the things I don’t).
[b]And now I’m going to teach you how to start your own successful business, too — to find an idea, find happy paying customers, all of it.
[p]I’ll show you how to get started, how to build your business up, and even how to make your income streams passive (if that’s what you want).
[p]Not in a scammy, “make a bazillion dollars in your slippers!!” way, but in a realistic way that’s step by step, fun, and fits into your life.
[p]Just like I’ve done for tens of thousands of students already. Now they’re living their Rich Lives:
[h4]“Life is good!”
[p]“My online business allows me to live and work from anywhere. Recently I moved to sunny Puerto Rico, which was a big dream of mine.
[p]“I live in a cute beach pad and enjoy midday swims in the turquoise ocean. And I get around my neighborhood on a cute, hot pink golf cart. Life is good!”
[b]SELENA SOO

[h4]“Memories and experiences that were priceless”
[p]“As a ‘thank you’ to our parents for being so generous with their time and money while raising us, my wife and I decided to take them on an all-expenses-paid trip to Finland and Sweden. It was a trip of a lifetime, and one that was only made possible by my online business. Here is a small sample of the things that we did as a big family while we were on the trip:
[span]Went dogsledding inside the Arctic Circle
[span]Ate a private meal from an award-winning chef cooked the traditional Finnish way, over an open flame (the best salmon I've ever tasted!)
[span]Visited a reindeer farm (didn't find Rudolph)
[span]Snowmobiled to the Russian border where a grandmother cooked us authentic beef stroganoff after we experienced a traditional Finnish sauna
[span]Took a food tour through the morning markets in Stockholm
[span]Hired a professional photographer to take pictures
[p]Overall, the trip cost us just over $15,000 but it created memories and experiences that were priceless. My parents still brag to everyone about it!”
[b]BEN DZIWULSKI
[p]WODPREP.COM
[h2]Well...that sounds great. So why isn’t everyone doing it?
[p]Here’s the interesting thing. When I asked my readers if they wanted to start a business, the overwhelming response was
[b]“YES! We want a business!”
[p]Why did they want their own business?
[p]No surprises here: All of us want the freedom, the control, and the multiple revenue streams.
[p]We want to know that if we put the work in, we can get more control, more freedom, and more income (not work our asses off to make someone else wealthy).
[p]So what’s the disconnect?
[p]Why do we all claim we want an online business — and we even read people like Seth Godin and Gary V and other motivational blogs — but we
[i]still
[p]haven’t started one yet?
[p]Well, we’re busy. We’re not sure where to start. A lot of us tell ourselves things like:
[span]"How can I start…I don’t have an idea yet"
[span]"What’s the right place to start a website? I don’t want to waste my time..."
[span]"I need to get my ducks in a row before I start this..."
[p]I’m not buying it. Here are hundreds of thousands of people, with 90% telling me they want to start a business. But what’s stopping them? Is it really a lack of information? (Isn’t there tons of info everywhere online?)
[b]There must be more going on here.
[p]If you simply asked random people what’s stopping them from building their Rich Life, you get the usual surface-level answers:
[span]"Because I have crazy debt from college..."
[span]"Who can get ahead when you’re struggling and overworked?"
[span]"It must be nice to be able to go on vacation..."
[span]"The rich are soaking us..."
[span]And some meme about boomers
[p]It’s important to know that these are all TRUE.
[p]But the real problem here — the fundamental issue — is deeper than all of this.
[b]The real problem is that the rules of success that worked for our parents don’t work anymore.
[p]We can either complain and wish for it to be different…
[p]…or take control of our situation right now.
[b]I choose to take control of my destiny.
[h2]The usual advice people give us — ZzzZzZZzz
[p]We’ve all heard the same advice over and over.
[p]OLD ADVICE:
[i]” Get into
[b]college.“
[b]The promise:
[span]College used to be the blueprint for success and happiness. Just get into college and you were set. Now there’s a whole generation of college graduates overwhelmed with tens of thousands of dollars of debt, trapped by low-wage jobs, working to pay off loans for the next 30 years...with no light at the end of the tunnel.
[b]When that fails:
[span]“You didn’t choose the right major.”
[p]Funny, they didn’t mention graduation rates, interest rates, how much the typical graduate can expect to make from that major, and the generationally high cost of housing. Weird. I wonder why they skipped mentioning that stuff.
[p]TRAPPED WITH STUDENT DEBT
[p]OLD ADVICE:
[i]"Get a good job and
[b]stick with it for 40 years.
[i]"
[b]The promise:
[span]Work for a big, respectable company like IBM, stay there for 30 years, then retire with a pension and benefits. (One of my relatives told me this when I was in college. I looked at him like he was insane: “Let me get this straight — you’re telling me I have to work at a job I don’t even love...doing mindless paper pushing...to eventually retire in 40 years? And THEN I can do what I want? No thanks. I don’t want to trade my best years for a pension.” But, since I’m Indian, I didn’t actually say any of that. I just smiled and said, “That’s interesting, Uncle.”)
[b]When that fails:
[span]“Ugh, you can’t stick with anything. You should just be happy to have a job! When I was your age, I took anything I could get. Look, here’s what you need to do: Put on a suit, walk into every business in this city, and hand the manager your resume. That’s how we did it in my day...”
[p]If you try to explain what it’s really like out there, suddenly they get quiet.
[em]“Wait, what? You don’t have a pension? No, that can’t be. I don’t know how I’d do it
[span]without my pension…”
[p]Or try telling them how employers expect us to be available 24×7 via Slack and email.
[p]“Oh, I wouldn’t like that very much.”
[p]Um, we know, Walter. How odd that they didn’t mention any of those things — because they never had our experience. Show them the facts, and they stammer, “Well…you should just try harder. That’s what we did.”
[p]JOB INSTABILITY
[p]OLD ADVICE:
[i]"Cut back on
[b]lattes!
[i]"
[b]The promise:
[span]“$3 a day adds up! It starts with the small things! What if you made coffee at home? After 329 years, you would have $100,000 in savings! Then you can retire in Florida!”
[b]When that fails:
[span]“You didn’t try hard enough. In fact, you should cut back on eating out, vacations, clothes, and lotion. Hobbies? LOL, so self-indulgent. Go for a walk in your public park and play with the dirt. It’s organic, you know. And free! BTW, if you don’t save 70% of your money and retire at 38, you’re a failure.”
[p]FRUGALITY PRESSURE
[p]I have to say, I love any philosophy that helps Americans save more money. But if your entire worldview is to cut back on tiny expenses for the next 40 years to defer life until you retire, and you spend 5 hours per week running Monte Carlo investment simulations because you hate your job…you might have taken a wrong turn in life. That’s not the life for me.
[b]And what happens if we actually follow all this advice?
[p]What do we get if we follow it perfectly, and go to college and get a good job and cut back on our lattes?
[b]An oversized, cookie-cutter house in suburbia?
[p]2 cars, 2 kids, and an hour-long commute to work? Hoping we can take a vacation with our precious 10 days of vacation, squeezed like sardines into our economy-class seats?
[p]The brutal truth is that even if we follow all this old advice and “win”…we actually lose.
[p]You and I intuitively know this advice doesn’t work. We know it because we can look around at the people 5 years older than us:
[span]They followed all the advice, worked hard and graduated…saddled with debt.
[span]They trudge to a job that’s fine — but doesn’t challenge them, doesn’t excite them, and will never let them escape the rat race.
[span]Yet...they just keep following the same advice.
[b]Average people
[p]take
[b]average advice
[p]and they get
[b]average results.
[p]It becomes a vicious cycle, where we start spinning our wheels — “What if I make the wrong decision and I’m stuck with it for the next 40 years?” — and suddenly
[i]we’re paralyzed
[p].
[h3]I CALL THIS THE GREAT SQUEEZE
[p]It’s the slow-burning trap that so many people are stuck in today.
[p]You know The Great Squeeze if someone asks you, “How are you?” and your answer is, “Tired.” I know I don’t mind working hard, but I want to know there’s a light at the end of the tunnel.
[b]This is why today’s work style is so broken.
[p]It doesn’t matter how hard you “hustle” if the rules of the game are stacked against you.
[b]It’s no wonder why there’s such an epidemic of anxiety, overwhelm, and unrelenting burnout.
[p]And it’s no wonder why so many ambitious, intelligent people get stuck.
[p]What are we supposed to do when it always feels like one step forward and two steps back? YES, we can take responsibility for our actions. And YES, we can do more. But what should we do? And how do we know it will work?
[p]The worst part is that the people who were supposed to help us — our parents and teachers and counselors — did nothing. They couldn’t. They didn’t have the answer!
[h2]Why we keep getting bad advice about success
[p]Go online. Pick up a magazine. We just hear the same broken advice, over and over.
[p]Cut back on lattes. Get a big house with a backyard and commute an hour a day…
[i]for the next 40 years
[p]. Oh, and working hard won’t help you because the system is stacked against you.
[p](All this advice from people who never made it. Why would I listen to you??)
[p]It’s not just that people are intentionally giving you bad advice. They’re not being malicious.
[i]They actually think they’re helping you
[p].
[p]But the advice is still horrible.
[p]AND WE KEEP LISTENING TO IT!
[p]Here’s what you need to know to see through the fog.
[p]First, know that advice givers will never admit their advice was bad. Instead, they’ll just tell you to double down. Try harder. “You didn’t do it right…what you really need to do is —”
[p]Here’s what you need to remember:
[i]“If you follow a
[b]doomed strategy
[i]— even if you execute it perfectly —
[b]you’re still doomed.
[i]”
[p]Let me show you what I mean with this terrible, horrible, no-good advice.
[p]Hey, here’s an idea. You want to be as smart as Albert Einstein?
[p]OK, lemme tell you what to do. You need to run into a brick wall 20 times with your head. What? You did it and you’re still not fluent in thermodynamic fluctuations? LOL! You didn’t try hard enough.
[i]Run into it 50 times
[p].
[p]And here, use this paper towel to clean your forehead off.
[p]Notice what they’re telling us: THAT BAD STRATEGY DIDN’T WORK…so DOUBLE DOWN. They never consider that maybe it’s a bad strategy in the first place! Save $3 on lattes! What, you’re not a millionaire? Cut back on water and make your own soap, you poor bastard.
[p]In reality, there’s a better way to live the life you want to.
[p]Be your own boss, do what you love, and earn more — not less.
[h2]How I escaped “The Great Squeeze”
[p]Yes! There’s a way to escape The Great Squeeze.
[p]But it means you have to take advice from winners.
[p]For example, early on, I knew I didn’t want to work a 9-5 job where I had to wake up to an alarm clock, go on a long commute, and settle for 10 days of vacation every year. But when I asked people what else I could do, they looked at me like I was crazy.
[p]I finally realized:
[i]If you want to live a different life, ask people who are already doing it.
[p]Why would I ask a 9-5 employee how to escape the 9-5? They have no fucking idea how.
[p]Amidst all the dire warnings of the sky falling, I discovered a small group of people winning:
[span]They earn more money than they ever thought.
[span]They control their time. No stressful commutes, no early-morning, bleary-eyed meetings.
[span]They’re building an ASSET that continues growing, even when they travel for a month at a time
[p]They don’t show up in headlines because what would journalists say? “These people did something completely different from what we tell you to do…and they’re winning. Uhh…is it possible our advice actually doesn’t work?”
[p]Uh oh. You’re not supposed to say that out loud. Easier to simply ignore them and pretend they’re exceptions.
[p]OK, let me show you how I escaped The Great Squeeze — with real numbers.
[p]This is how I went from growing up middle class — no fancy private high school, no rich parents — to eventually starting my own business and owning my time.
[b]The college years:
[p]I didn’t know anything about starting a business. Definitely not how to create a recurring revenue stream or “passive” income. I didn’t even have an idea. I mean, look at me:
[i]Ramit Sethi, 2002. What a catch.
[p]All I knew was that I had something I wanted to share with the world. You know that feeling when you spend your free time reading everything you can about the thing you love? When you start noticing your friends coming to you for advice?
[p]After a while you start to realize, “Hey, I’m pretty good at this.”
[p]For some of us, it’s helping others lose weight, or learn a musical instrument, or have better relationships. It could be anything! (I’ve seen online businesses helping parents have a better experience at Disney World…teaching men how to connect with their wives…and even showing pet owners how to train their parrot to talk.)
[p]Whatever it is, we all have something that other people struggle with…and it just seems to come naturally to us.
[p]I knew that I was good at my passion (personal finance) — and that I could help people, if only they would listen.
[p]So I decided to try helping people learn about money by teaching a free informal class in college. (Not a business. Just a class.) I thought it was a no-brainer…but NOBODY SEEMED TO CARE!
[p]For about a year and a half, I struggled to get anyone to listen, even though I knew I could help them.
[p]Remember, this was before Instagram or YouTube or Facebook. It was before Shopify and podcasts and Medium and the thousands of other tools built to make sharing your passion easy. I had none of that. It was one of the most frustrating, draining times of my life.
[p]Something wasn’t working.
[p]So I decided to start a website.
[p]I figured there are millions of people online, and if I could somehow put out a “net” to catch the right people, I could get them to read my material.
[p](And stop beating my head against the wall for people who really didn’t care!)
[p]In the beginning, I didn’t have a business. It was just a dinky blog I ran from my dorm room with ZERO traffic.
[p]I hardly had any comments for the first year.
[i]I used a free template for my blog. No ads, no revenue model — I just wanted to get started
[p]If you had told me I would turn something I loved doing anyway into a multimillion-dollar business, I never would have believed you.
[p]In fact, looking back, I made every mistake under the sun:
[span]I wasted time chasing weird monetization tactics like sponsorships and AdSense
[span]I got distracted by trying shiny tools
[span]I got overwhelmed by all the advice out there and spun my wheels trying to figure it out on my own
[p]But there were a few core choices I got right. (More on those soon…)
[p]And I was learning.
[p]I learned how to come up with an idea that people found mouthwateringly irresistible.
[p]I learned how to package it up in a way that would resonate with them (how annoying is it when you try to give your friends advice and they don’t listen?).
[p]And over time, my site started generating revenue.
[p]At first, it was a tiny amount.
[p]But once I made my first $5, I realized I could make more — and help the people who really wanted to be helped.
[p]That’s when I started going deeper and learning how to build a SUCCESSFUL business online. Not just making a few bucks here or there, not just dipping my toes in the water,
[b]but playing to win.
[p]Fast forward to now:
[p]I’ve built the business systems to launch over 20 successful products — helping millions of people master their money, careers, psychology, and businesses.
[p]I get to work on what I want, when I want. I’m in control.
[p]My business systems keep bringing in money — whether I’m working, watching Netflix, hanging out with friends, sleeping, or even traveling for 6 weeks every year.
[p]My business PAYS ME to live the life of my dreams!
[b]My business is my ticket out of The Great Squeeze.
[p]My business is my ticket to my Rich Life!
[p]Every day I wake up thankful that I don’t have a commute to race through and a boss to answer to.
[p]I’m thankful I get paid to work on my passions and share my ideas with the world.
[p]I’m thankful my business is always working — so that I don’t have to be.
[p]And I’m not the only one.
[p]I’ve shared this system with my students and now they’re running successful businesses and living their own Rich Lives because of it:
[h4]"Six weeks in the south of France….all the while I didn't need to work"
[p]“One summer I was able to spend six weeks in the south of France with my family. My wife and two daughters stayed in Airbnbs in Provence for a month, and I stayed an extra two weeks to visit a friend in London. From there, I cycled up the French Pyrenees Mountains during the Tour de France (and got to watch the race in person multiple days!).
[p]“All the while I didn’t need to work except for about two hours per week to check in on things and answer a few emails.”

[h4]"Take a month-long trip to Italy…just because!"
[p]One of my favorites is being able to take a month-long trip to Italy with my wife and son – just because! In fact, I’m writing this to you from Italy! We’ve spent far more family time here than we have back home in San Diego. And given that I run my business remotely, we haven’t lost a step there. It’s been such a blessing.”

[h2]Which of these 6 Invisible Scripts is holding you back from starting your business?
[p]For most of us, starting a business isn’t the normal path. (Hey, if I’d followed my default life path, I’d be sitting in a cubicle at a tech company, working as some kind of “program manager” and wearing one of those badges attached to the belt loops of my poorly fitting jeans.)
[p]So our mind starts playing tricks on us, whispering things like:
[span]“You? You’re not an entrepreneur”
[span]“You should just be happy…”
[span]“You don’t have a business idea”
[span]“Maybe someday…but not right now”
[p]I knew I could never be happy waiting and waiting for “someday.”
[p]So I began the years-long process of examining my inner psychology to find out how I could change.
[p]Why wasn’t I growing the way I wanted to — despite all the free information out there?
[p]I discovered a concept I call “Invisible Scripts,” or beliefs so deeply held that they’re actually invisible to us.
[p]For example, many Americans believe “real estate is the best investment” and craft our lives around it. But is it really?
[p]If we dig deeper, we might be surprised.
[p]When it comes to your online business, here are the 6 most pernicious Invisible Scripts I discovered.
[p]As you read, take a hard look to see which of these apply to you…
[p]SCRIPT #1:
[i]"I don't have an idea."
[strong]I don’t have an idea.
[p]How are you supposed to come up with an idea that hasn’t already been done a thousand times before? And even if you do come up with an idea, how do you know it will work? Who wants to spend a ton of time on an idea that might fail — leaving you worse off than when you started?
[strong]Too many ideas.
[p]This is just as crippling as no idea. What do you do when you have too many ideas? How do you pick ONE? And does that mean you have to close the door on all your other interests forever? Is there a way to “stitch” together your interests into one idea that works? Maybe, but you don’t see how.
[p]SCRIPT #2:
[i]"I don’t know
[b]where to start!
[i]"
[strong]Where do I start?
[p]Ugh, there are a million websites about starting an online business. Some people tell us we NEED a Facebook page…then others tell us to ignore that advice. How do you know which advice to listen to? Who do you trust? Is it just a bunch of snake-oil salesmen, or is there really anyone teaching out there who can prove they know what they’re talking about? How do I put the pieces of the puzzle together?
[strong]I’m not a tech expert.
[p]What if you’re not a website expert? How much is it going to cost to set one up? Then how do you find a designer who will help you…without paying thousands and thousands of dollars to start? Oh, now I have to set up an autoresponder sequence…payment authorization…content distribution…video encoding…protecting my material…AHHHH! You didn’t start this to be a tech expert! You just want to share your passion with the world. Is there a way to just make this technology stuff work?
[p]SCRIPT #3:
[i]"I don't have time to waste on something that
[b]doesn't work!"
[i]"
[strong]I don’t want to invest months of work building something that flops.
[p]How heartbreaking is it to spend months setting up a website, building social media profiles, writing posts…only to discover no one is interested? Or worse, to find out people claim they “love” your free stuff…but when it comes time to pay, they mysteriously disappear.
[p]SCRIPT #4:
[i]"Why would anyone
[b]buy from me?
[i]"
[strong]There’s already a ton of information out there.
[p]Why would anyone choose you over all these other people? Some of them have had websites for years. They have way more traffic, more connections, more money. Why would someone choose you? How would they even find you?
[strong]I’m not an expert.
[p]Other people have been doing this for 10+ years. A lot of them have professional certifications, books, and even TV appearances. Why would anyone listen to you? And if you’re not sure about yourself, how can you expect other people to take you seriously?
[p]SCRIPT #5:
[i]"I
[b]hate
[i]selling!"
[strong]Selling = sleazy.
[p]Does anyone really LIKE to sell? You see these over-the-top bottom feeders online, and they’re always hawking some scammy e-book about creating e-books. Why can’t you just do good work and get noticed? How can you start a business on your terms?
[p]SCRIPT #6:
[i]"It's
[b]not a good time
[i]right now."
[strong]How much time will this take?
[p]Who has the time to start another project? Especially if you’re not sure it’s going to succeed? Maybe one day when you have more time.
[strong]I don’t want to create another job for myself.
[p]What if this actually starts selling? What if you’re not a 20-something with unlimited time? Now you have a SECOND full-time job for yourself! Do you have to update your blog almost every day now? And fix your website? And answer all these customer service emails? Ugh, you didn’t want this to create more work for yourself.
[strong]I just need to figure it out first.
[p]Starting an online business is definitely on the bucket list, but what about all the prep before starting it? How do you make sure you’re ready? Shouldn’t you read all those books on your Amazon wish list first?
[p]I get it. I went through every single one of these Invisible Scripts myself!
[p]The solution is not to ignore these scripts. THEY’RE REAL! And they make us feel uncomfortable for a reason.
[p]I learned to listen to what they were really telling me. For example, when most people get negative comments, they get scared and say, “Ok, the solution is to never write anything controversial.” But how limiting is that!
[p]When I started, a negative comment like this petrified me:
[p]But I didn’t quit. I kept working. And I found that I could conquer that Invisible Script and move on to the next step.
[p]Just like every step of starting your business. You won’t make a million dollars your first year. Nobody does! But taking it step by step, you can start to get small results…then bigger…until finally, people look at you and say, “Wow, I wish I could do that.”
[p]After years of cataloging my own Invisible Scripts, I started to see the patterns that had held me back — and probably hold a lot of us back from starting a business.
[p]The code word for starting a business is OVERWHELM.
[p]It’s not just the technology part of starting a business online (actually, that’s the least of it). It’s knowing what idea to pursue. And whose advice we should follow. And eventually, the overwhelm leads back to ourselves — am I good enough? Why would anyone listen to me? Am I ready to try this, or do I need more experience?
[b]It’s so easy to get STUCK in this loop.
[p]When I asked over 275,000 readers how long they’ve been thinking about starting a business, the answers were shocking:
[p]What?!
[p]Almost HALF of these people have been thinking about starting a business…
[i]for years
[p].
[p]“Years” is too long to wait and hope.
[p]Maybe it’s time to start today.
[p]I learned not to suppress these fears, but instead to embrace them. I learned not to try to solve them with information, but with ACTION. Am I good enough? I don’t know. But instead of waiting around, I decided to find out.
[p]I got better every step of the way, and a few years later, even though I didn’t have a credential like a CFP, I’ve helped thousands of people improve their finances, earn more money, find dream jobs, and start their own businesses.
[p]What a shame to let our Invisible Scripts remain unexamined. And what an even bigger shame to never reach our potential.
[b]Fortunately, there is GOOD NEWS.
[p]Step 1 is identifying your Invisible Scripts, which you’ve already started to recognize.
[p]The next step? Acknowledge them…and then systematically conquer them.
[p]When you decide to ignore those little voices in your head, the results can be absolutely amazing — faster than you think.
[p]Let me show you some of the startling numbers.
[h2]The surprising math behind starting your own business
[p]Let’s say you take an idea and turn it into side income. You’re still working at your full-time job, but you’re putting in a little more time to earn $500/month on the side.
[p]If you want, you can “tune” that number to $1,000/month…or $2,500/month…or $10,000/month. Or you can automate it.
[p]Imagine an extra $1,000/month going straight into your checking account…month after month…for the rest of your life.
[p]What could you do with an extra $1,000/month?
[span]Build up enough savings to work for yourself. Tell your boss you appreciate the job, but you’ve decided to go off on your own — and do what you love
[span]Travel to South America for 1 month/year...or Tahiti...or Australia. (One year, I took 6 weeks off to visit Italy, Kenya, India, and Thailand...and the next year, I spent another 6 weeks visiting India and Japan.)
[span]Apply your extra money to the principal on your mortgage. If you had a 30-year fixed $200,000 mortgage and you paid an extra $1,000/month, you’d pay it off 19 years early and save $98,732
[span]Enjoy extra spending money for things like eating out — and ordering anything you want! — weekend beach trips, or buying new clothes guilt-free
[span]Sleep great at night knowing that your bills are paid, you’ve got extra money in the bank, and you’re not squeezed by money worries
[p]One day, you might find yourself actually earning more on the side, in less time, than you do at your day job.
[b]The most eye-opening truth in all of this?
[p]There is
[u]nothing
[p]stopping you from building your own business. One that pays YOU to live the life YOU want.
[h2]Run the numbers: How much could you earn with your own business?
[p]When I started, I had no idea what “success” really looked like. In fact, I resisted running ads on my blog because — ugh — I said, “if it doesn’t cover my rent, it’s not worth it.”
[p]My rent! That was my dim dream!
[p]Now, my business generates enough income to cover my rent in just a few hours of the first day of the month. And the best part is, thousands and thousands of successful students have used this system to grow their own income.
[b]I want to make success crystal clear for you:
[p]Use the calculator below to see precisely how much your business can generate. It might seem hard to believe because you haven’t started yet (just like how I used to be amazed that people made $20/hour!), but I’ve been there — and I’ve helped many students achieve precisely these kinds of results.
[p]You can, too.

[b]“I’m doing over $10,000 per month
[p]when previously I thought in a good YEAR I might like to do $10,000. Overall, I feel less stress about finances. I used to wake up in the morning and kind of feel like I had to go, go, go. Making money to pay for all these things. Thinking ahead and saving and scrimping. Having a growing business takes a lot of that stress and pressure off of me, knowing that you have this asset that’s going to keep on allowing you to live your life without having to feel like you’re in the rat race every single day.”

[p]“What helped was understanding how to put the marketing together.
[b]This month, we’ll end on $30,000 in revenue — our largest month this year with just under 8,000 subscribers.
[p]Because of my online business, my family and I are leaving soon to travel to Europe for 2 months, and hang out and run the business while we’re there. This is something we’ve wanted to do for years.”
[h6]SCOTT BARLOW
[p]HAPPEN TO YOUR CAREER
[h2]What your own business allows you to do
[p]One of the best parts of having your own business is that you’re in control. You can decide what you want to do — and how and when. This allows you to build a business to fit your life.
[h3]YOU CAN START SMALL
[p]If you don’t have an idea, you can follow a step-by-step process to find one.
[p]Some people just want a little side business that gives them some extra guilt-free spending money every month — and that’s great. Other people want more. That’s great, too!
[h3]YOU CAN GROW AT YOUR OWN PACE
[p]Here’s a look at the products I’ve created over the years. What do you notice?
[p]I grew at my own pace. Some years, I went slow. Some years, I launched multiple products.
[p]Some of the products are less than $100. Some are over $5,000.
[p]A business allows you to grow at your own pace. If you want to grow faster…you can! But if you want to keep it small or slow down because you have other priorities in your life, you can do that, too.
[h3]YOU CAN BUILD AN ASSET
[p]An asset pays you — even while you’re sleeping. Take a look at your own finances: If you stopped working today, what would you have to show for it? Yes, you have skills. And hopefully, you’ve invested in a 401(k).
[p]But a business allows you to create an asset that can generate income for years to come.
[p]For example, I created a product over 6 years ago that still generates tens of thousands of dollars
[i]every month
[p].
[p]When you create your own business, you’re going to work — just like you work now — but after that work, you’ll have an asset that’s yours. Nobody can take that from you. And that asset can produce income for years and years.
[p]This product is so old, it’s not even in
[p]that chart above. It’s an asset that
[p]continued to sell, even years later.
[h2]How I travel for 6 weeks per year
[p]A few years ago, I decided to take a 6-week vacation. Every year.
[p]No computer. No email. No business (well, I spend 1 hour per week on my business while traveling — the rest runs in the background).
[p]My wife and I stay at the world’s best hotels, while eating street food and going deep on culture and design.
[p]Here’s how this happened.
[p]For our honeymoon, my wife and I were planning to take an 8-day safari. We were eating out with friends who asked us what we were thinking of doing.
[p]“We’re going to go on safari. Maybe 8 days in Kenya,” we told them.
[p]“That sounds amazing,” one of them said. “When we got married, we took 6 months off! We still remember it.”
[p]Hold on a second — 6 MONTHS?
[p]The next couple told us they took a year off and traveled around the world.
[p]My wife and I walked out of that dinner with 2 questions:
[li]Who the hell were these people? We thought they were normal people…but who takes MONTHS off?
[li]What if…?
[b]What if
[p]we expanded our dream of how long we could take off? Where did we come up with 8 days, anyway?
[p]So we decided to take a once-in-a-lifetime trip to Italy, Kenya, India, and Thailand. We brought our parents with us to Italy — we told them, “Just show up at the airport and we’ll handle the rest” — and created memories we’ll never forget.
[p]At the end of our honeymoon, we decided not to make this a once-in-a-lifetime experience. We decided to do it every year.
[p]The next year, we went to India and Japan.
[p]For this 6-week trip, I didn’t bring a laptop (just my iPad). We stayed at places like the Oberoi in Ranthambore and Aman Tokyo. We designed our own scarves using traditional Indian block printing. We also met a local couple who invited us into their apartment to teach us about Japanese interior design. And throughout my travels…
[p]…working one hour per week…
[p]…my business grew.
[p]Best of all, we created memories we’ll never forget.
[p]This is
[i]my
[p]Rich Life. Yours might be different, but you have one
[span]—
[span]waiting to be lived.
[b]What if
[span]you could travel for 6 weeks?
[b]What if
[p]you could take your family along?
[b]What if
[p]your first concern wasn’t price — but the memories you’d create?
[p]With your own business, suddenly you can step outside of the day to day and ask: “
[b]What if
[p]?”
[h2]BRUTAL TRUTH: You don’t simply need more information
[p]By this point, you’ve realized you can start a business.
[p]The most common question I get right here — right now! — is: “Yeah, but where do I find an idea?”
[p]What they’re really saying is: “Yeah, this sounds great, but…”
[span]"I need to figure it out”
[span]“Can I Google for 20 business ideas?”
[span]“I don’t have time”
[p]The normal response is to DO MORE RESEARCH. Let me find out some facts! Let me try to finally do that thing I’ve been meaning to do for the last 3 years! Let me….
[b]Stop and ask yourself this: If I gave you the perfect business idea tomorrow, would you know what to do?
[p]Would you know…
[span]How to set up a website that converts?
[span]Where to find waves of new customers?
[span]How to sell without being sleazy?
[span]How to build a rapidly growing email list, how to package up the idea into a mouthwatering product, how much to charge, and how to set up all the technology, marketing systems, and payment processing?
[p]Why not? Theoretically, you could find all of that “information” online for free…so why haven’t you?
[p]I know why, because I was in the same situation. Because it’s overwhelming. Because we don’t know where to start. Because we’re afraid of failing, of not knowing who to trust, and of wasting our time.
[p]This took me a long time to really “get.” As a logical guy, I used to think if I wanted something, I’d just decide to do it, then get it done.
[p]If you’re reading this, you know life doesn’t work like that!
[p]Take losing weight: There are tons of “free workouts” online. So why do we find it so hard to go to the gym? We need
[i]more than
[p]just info. Same with personal finance, cooking, maintaining good relationships…there are so many examples.
[p]If information alone mattered, almost nobody would be overweight, or unproductive, or in debt.
[i]The truth is, if you just wanted information, you would have found it already.
[p]There’s only one thing that really matters.
[h2]Where will you be 12 months from now?
[p]Today, you have to make a decision.
[p]If you decide to wait until “someday,” that’s a decision.
[p]But I’d like to suggest a different path:
[b]Make a decision to escape The Great Squeeze.
[p]Take a hard look in the mirror and acknowledge the things you really want. You want to travel for a month every year? You want to wake up every day — no alarm clock — and work on the things you love? Great. You deserve to live the life you want. Now let’s put the work in to get it.
[b]Stop following average advice from average people.
[p]When we listen to people tell us why we shouldn’t dream — why it’s “impossible” and why we “should just be happy” — we settle for less. We minimize our dreams. And we accept a life that’s less than what could be.
[b]Stop trying to do everything yourself.
[p]Winners get help. Atul Gawande, the surgeon and New Yorker writer, noticed a curious phenomenon about the people at the top of their craft.
[p]“I watched Rafael Nadal play a tournament match on the Tennis Channel. The camera flashed to his coach, and the obvious struck me as interesting: even Rafael Nadal has a coach. Nearly every elite tennis player in the world does. Professional athletes use coaches to make sure they are as good as they can be.”
[p]ATUL GAWANDE
[p]Why is it that every one of the world’s top athletes has a coach or advisors — yet we don’t? And not just athletes. Politicians, entertainers, the best of the best.
[p]If even the world’s best can benefit from advice, imagine how much WE could benefit from getting advice from someone who can give us the systems, psychology, and support we need.
[p]Someone who can SHOW us the roadmap to success…
[span]How to build a business that genuinely helps people
[span]The exact details of how to find a business idea, how to create a profitable product, and how to find customers that happily buy even as you sleep

[p]And you don’t have to take the word of someone who’s only built a business selling e-books teaching others how to create e-books to sell e-books teaching e-books…
[p]We’ve distilled everything down and refined it into an uber-efficient and effective program. We’ve built a community to support you along the way. We’ve recorded online business makeovers with real students. And we’ve helped thousands of students create businesses in 50+ different industries — travel, software, coaching, fitness, roofing. We know we can help you.
[p]We’ve included all of our best material on all types of businesses — from super-flexible freelancing to powerhouse online businesses to automated “muse” businesses.
[p]All it takes is a few hours a week to master one of the most powerful, profit-generating tools on the market.
[p]“What I’ve learned from Ramit is way more than what I spent over 100K to learn in business school.
[b]Thank you Ramit for changing my life
[p]and helping me make a bigger impact in the world.”

[p]“It just so happens I made my retirement plan of travel, excitement, exploration, and adventure also my business plan.
[b]It’s been amazing to live this way
[p], especially with such an amazing team along for the ride!”
[h6]AARON VELKY
[h2]How is
[i]Earnable
[h2]different?
[p]First, proof matters.
[i]Earnable
[p]is the ONLY online business program proven over
[u]15+ years
[p],
[u]50+ industries
[p], and
[u]42,000+
[p]students. You don’t build that kind of track record by accident.
[p]Not only have we helped tens of thousands of people start their own business and live their own Rich Lives, but we continually get access to massive amounts of data on what really works — which we include in the program.
[p]Every step of the way, we asked ourselves one question:
[b]What would make
[i]Earnable
[b]magic?
[p]Then we took all of our answers and built them right into the program.
[p]The end result is the most comprehensive business program available:
[h3]FAST RESULTS
[p]Forget about the years-long research process. Go from “no idea” to your first paying client in weeks.
[h3]VERIFIED 6-FIGURE EARNERS
[p]Go behind the scenes of Verified 6-Figure Businesses — instant access to what's working now.

[h3]THE COMPLETE SYSTEM
[i]Everything
[p]you need to build an automated business that PAYS YOU to live your own Rich Life.
[p]Only
[i]Earnable
[p]includes comprehensive data from dozens of industries, hundreds of tests we’ve run — AND fresh insights, scripts, examples and case studies from our 40,000+ paying customers.
[p]You can try to do it on your own…but why would you? If you’re serious about starting a business, give yourself the advantage of tens of thousands of people who’ve come before you.
[i]Earnable
[p]includes specific tactics you can use right away. This is NOT some rah-rah motivational book that makes you feel good for a few days…but leaves you right where you started.
[p]It’s NOT an e-book stuffed with “filler” content to get you to buy another, more expensive product.
[p]And it’s NOT a mish-mash of “tips” you can find for free on Google.
[i]Earnable
[p]is a
[b]deliberate and proven process
[p]for building a profitable business.
[i]Earnable
[p]is designed with a
[b]ruthless focus on results
[p]. I’m not interested in “kumbaya” inspiration. I want you to succeed. That means I know every single strategy and tactic in
[i]Earnable
[p]works because I’ve tested it (and tested it again) in my own business. And my students have tested them, too.
[p]Best of all,
[i]Earnable
[p]gives you full access to the strategies, systems, and tools that are changing the lives of my students and helping them grow their businesses — REAL businesses with REAL income — and live their own Rich Lives.
[p]REAL BUSINESSES FROM MY STUDENTS
[i]In just the examples above, notice the different industries: Personal styling, marketing, productivity, nutrition, college admissions, personal finance, and more.
[p]If you’re wondering whether
[i]Earnable
[p]will work for 40-somethings, busy moms, international students, men, women, experienced entrepreneurs, first-time beginners, and everything in between, the answer is…
[p]WE TESTED EVERY STRATEGY, TACTIC, AND SCRIPT IN THE PROGRAM!
[i]Earnable
[p]will work for all of those categories, and more.
[p]“I’m now able to afford extra help around the house so
[b]I can concentrate on my art and my family.”
[h6]LAUREN HAULE
[p]DIGGING UP LIGHT
[p]“On Tuesday, I worked from a meeting room at a local library, brainstorming new product ideas on a whiteboard. Then, I called up a friend and we met up for a long lunch on a whim.
[b]I had no boss checking their watch and waiting for me to get back to the office. No clock to punch.
[p]For me, that freedom has made me 10x happier than I ever was during my 13 years of being an employee.”
[h6]JEFF CALLAHAN
[p]BECOME MORE COMPELLING
[h2]Introducing the
[i]Earnable
[h2]Playbooks
[p]We’ve pioneered a new way to give you even more material to launch and grow your business. We call them
[i]Earnable Playbooks
[p].
[b]The old way:
[p]In the past, other programs gave you an exhausting list of videos, PDFs, and cobbled-together “bonus material.” It was easy to log in and be impressed by the quantity of information, but where do you start? Do you really need a 13-page PDF on how to buy a domain?
[b]The new way:
[p]We reinvented business training from the ground up. Each
[i]Earnable
[p]Playbook is a
[u]complete
[p],
[u]current
[p], and
[u]step-by-step
[p]SYSTEM for accomplishing a major milestone in starting and growing your business.
[p]For example, if you want to know about selling, use the
[i]Earnable
[p]Playbook on sales, which includes specific prices to use, videos on sales psychology, real sales tactics used by Verified 6-Figure Earners in different industries, and
[i]actual recordings of real sales calls.
[p]No other program gives you this level of specific detail.
[p]No other program includes such an in-depth collection of strategies, tactics, and psychology.

[h4]"Me living my Rich Life..."
[p]“In August 2018, I participated in a week-long luxury immersion experience in Mexico City. It cost $5,000+ for six days.
[span]I spent a week taking one-on-one Spanish lessons, meeting influential thinkers in Mexico City, and even taking a private, after-hours tour of the National Museum of Anthropology.
[p]But the crown jewel of the experience was when I had dinner at Pujol, the #1 restaurant in North America. The blending of cuisine, culture, and language was perfect, and I even got to meet the chef and tour the kitchen after dinner. Here is me living my Rich Life in the kitchen at Pujol.”

[h4]"This is the best gift I've ever been given!"
[p]“I’m notoriously bad at giving gifts. I never felt like a material good was sufficient enough to delight someone. And that usually meant I didn’t get anyone any gifts, including my sisters or my partner, Katie.
[p]So when I met executive chef Josh, who goes to people’s homes to cook exquisite eight-course meals for couples or parties, I knew what I had to do. I hired Josh to cook a meal for Katie for Mother’s Day. She said, ‘This is the best gift I’ve ever been given!’ Now, I know that the most beautiful experiences will be the gifts I give to those I care about.”

[span]T
[p]hat’s why I created
[strong]Earnable Live
[p], our
[em]hands-on
[p], no-excuses coaching experience designed to help you
[em]start fast, stay accountable,
[p]and actually
[em]launch
[p]the business that’s been sitting in your head for years.
[p]I didn’t build
[i]Earnable Live
[p]to be something passive with hundreds of people lurking in the background.
[span]You’ll get direct feedback, live coaching, and the kind of support that actually moves the needle
[span].
[strong]NEW: The 5-Week Live Sprint
[p]Once you’re in, you’ll be invited to join our LIVE 5-week sprint — the structured, action-packed accelerator where you’ll make more progress in 5 weeks than most people do in 5 years of spinning their wheels.
[b]Plus,
[i]Earnable Live
[b]students get access to all future
[i]Earnable Live
[b]group sessions.
[p]If your first business idea doesn’t work out, you can go through the group sessions again with a second idea.
[span]If your first idea goes wild and you have employees to help you run it, you can go through the sessions AGAIN to develop your next successful idea.
[p]Each session tackles the most
[em]critical
[p]part of launching your business, with clear goals and immediate support:
[span]Week 1: Find your business idea (even if you’ve got “nothing” right now)
[span]Week 2: Craft an irresistible offer people actually want to buy
[span]Week 3: Get inside your customers' heads — and win their trust
[span]Week 4: Make your first sale (Yes, in 4 weeks. Not 4 months.)
[span]Week 5: Build your Profit Playbook to scale what works
[p]You’ll walk out of these sessions with a
[em]real business
[p]— not just a bunch of ideas and PDFs collecting digital dust. (Need to miss a workshop? No problem. Everything will be recorded and shared.)
[strong]Earnable Live students get free access
[p]to every future round of these live coaching sprints.
[p]That means:
[p]If your first idea doesn’t land? Come back with another.
[p]If you scale up and need to evolve? Come back and refine.
[p]If you’re stuck and need a reboot? Come back and reset.
[p]This is your lifetime pass to expert support
[strong].
[b]NEW: LIVE monthly workshops with Ramit
[span]I’ll be hosting LIVE workshops every month, which you’ll have access to as soon as you join the program — there’s no limit to how many of these you can attend.
[span]We’ll deep dive into a new business topic every month, and I’ll answer your most pressing questions and do live teardowns. You’ll get the same type of no-nonsense, no-BS coaching that I give on my podcast and on the Netflix show.
[b]NEW:
[i]Earnable Live
[b]Slack community
[p]The
[i]Earnable Live
[p]tier also includes an
[b]online community
[p]where you can ask questions from other beginners, intermediate 6-figure earners, and even 7-figure experts.
[p]Imagine being surrounded by people who want you to succeed, who are there to cheer you on, and who are eager to share what’s working for them.
[b]Your questions about finding an idea
[p]— answered.
[b]Your concerns about accountability
[p]— resolved.
[b]Your worry about getting stuck
[p]— Let’s be honest! No matter how detailed this program is, you’ll invariably get stuck. It’s just natural. That happens to every new business owner. The #1 thing that helped was being able to turn to more experienced people and ask how they’d handled it.
[p]Here’s just one example from Akash Thakkar, one of my
[i]Earnable
[p]students:
[b]“All my previous launches before taking your in-person class hovered around $8-10K on average … my most recent launch was $25K (with the exact same product I was launching before) and it was an absolute blast to manage.
[p]No stress and barely any extra time investment after the systems were in place. Amazed at the results and thank you so much for creating such great material.”
[p]This kind of live and interactive access is priceless and can literally save you years and tens of thousands of dollars of heartache.
[p]That’s why we built live workshops, hosted by me, and lifetime access to the online community into
[i]Earnable Live.
[h2]Is
[i]Earnable
[h2]right for you?
[p]I’m extremely selective about who I allow into my programs because I’m in the enviable position of not needing to appeal to everyone — just the right people. I’d rather work with a small group of people who are committed to taking action than a large group of wantrepreneurs who are looking for the latest magic bullet.
[p]Please read this carefully, because these rules are ironclad.
[i]Earnable
[b]is NOT for you if…
[span]You’re looking for a magic bullet (a program that spits out a million-dollar business) without putting in the challenging work of idea generation, validation, customer research, marketing, pricing, packaging, and positioning
[span]You’re starting from $0 and expect to make $1,250,000 in 8 weeks. Get-rich-quick schemers, please leave
[span]You already have a business or business idea, which is struggling, and you aren’t willing to change your idea. If you resist new advice, how can I help you?
[span]You’re simply looking for “motivation” and “inspiration.” I believe the most motivational thing you can do is get RESULTS, so while I’m friendly and supportive (or so I’ve been told), I’m ultimately concerned with your success, not if you “like” me
[span]You’re unemployed. The only exception is if you have more than enough in savings to comfortably join the course
[span]You have credit card debt. Sorry, your first duty is to pay it off. You will not be allowed in until you do, and if I find out you joined with CC debt, I will ban you from ever purchasing any of my products again. This rule has cost me millions of dollars over the last couple of years, but it’s the right thing to do. I’m not interested in opening this course to everyone — just the right people
[i]Earnable
[b]is right for you if…
[span]You’re ready to invest in yourself to build a successful online business
[span]You’re patient, deliberate, and methodical. You’re committed to spending the time to build a successful online business, and you know this will not happen overnight. You know that if you put in 5-10 hours a week and do the heavy lifting upfront, you can enjoy the rewards for years to come
[span]You’re looking for a SYSTEM, not random tactics
[span]You’re emotionally stable enough to weather the “ups and downs” of starting an online business. As New Edition said, “Can You Stand The Rain”?
[p]Here are some of the results of students who decided my programs were right for them.
[p]I ran headlong into creating a consultation package and did my first launch. While my conversion rate for program applications was awesome (3.6%) and while people actually bought my $740 package, my biggest win has been the feedback I’ve gotten from my participants. They have grown in ways they didn’t think was possible for them. And their wins have been massive!
[b]To know — really know — that I can generate revenue and help to change people’s lives — well shit. It’s a game-changer.”
[h6]TIFFANY MCLAIN
[p]As a customer and reader,
[b]I thought the way Ramit ran his online business was phenomenal
[p]. I wanted to get into his head. ‘Who better to learn from?’ I thought. I was sure there was stuff I didn’t know I was doing wrong.”
[h6]GRAHAM COCHRANE
[h2]Frequently Asked Questions
[h4]WILL THIS WORK...?
[h6]"What if I don't even have a business idea?"
[i]Earnable
[b]will show you how to find your business idea.
[p]You do not need an idea to join. We’ll show you exactly how to dig into your own skillset and come up with multiple ideas. Then, we’ll take you through the process we use at IWT to “test” ideas for profitability. You’ll quickly know precisely which idea will work
[i]before
[p]you invest tons of time into pursuing it.
[p]We heard loud and clear from students how finding an idea can be tough. No one wants to be stuck searching for an idea for months. That’s why we developed a much more rapid way to find your profitable idea. Now, even if you have “no idea” — you can find an exciting, profitable one and get started in just a couple days. We’ll show you how.
[h6]"How is Earnable different from other courses on the market?"
[b]This is the ONLY program that has been proven over 15+ years, in 50+ industries, and with 42,000+ paying customers.
[p]That kind of longevity doesn’t happen by accident. Or by cutting corners. It comes by delivering outstanding value, year after year after year.
[b]This is the ONLY business program that covers the entire process of starting and growing your business.
[i]Earnable
[p]shows you everything: how to find your business idea, how to build an irresistible offer, how to find paying clients, how to grow your income, and how to systematize everything to start living YOUR Rich Life.
[b]This is the ONLY program that lets you decide what kind of business you want to build.
[p]We will show you how to build an automated, passive business earning 7 figures a year … or a full-time 6-figure consultancy … or just a super-flexible side hustle that puts a few hundred bucks in your pocket each month. You decide which is right for you.
[p]And since you get lifetime access to everything in
[i]Earnable
[p], you don’t have to decide now. You can change your mind tomorrow, next week, next year. Or you can build multiple businesses.
[p]With
[i]Earnable
[p], you get ALL of this, protected by a 60-day, 100% money-back guarantee. Nothing else comes close.
[h6]"How much help am I going to get? What if I get stuck?"
[p]We are here to help! You can choose which version of
[i]Earnable
[p]you want based on how much support you want.
[p]Some people prefer to work on their own. If that’s you, we offer the core version of
[i]Earnable
[p]– including ALL 15 Playbooks packed with the systems, mindsets, and step-by-step instructions you need to start and grow your business. Everything you need to know is included, at our lowest price.
[p]If you want extra help, we also offer
[i]Earnable Live
[p]. This version of the program includes everything in the core version, PLUS
[u]weekly group sessions
[p],
[u]live monthly calls hosted by me
[p],  and a
[u]Slack community
[p].
[i]Earnable Live
[p]students receive lifetime access to both the online community and all future
[i]Earnable Live
[p]calls.
[p]Again, if you want extra help, we recommend you join
[i]Earnable Live
[p].
[h6]"When can I expect to make money?"
[b]I can’t promise you specific results from your business in a specific time frame. Nobody can. And you shouldn’t trust anyone who does.
[p]Here’s why: We all begin at different levels of sophistication, experience, and skill. We all have different markets. It would make no sense to promise “one size fits all” results just to get you to like me. In fact, I’d rather be honest about the challenging nature of this material, which is why I added lifetime access and ongoing support.
[p]That said, one of our primary focuses in creating
[i]Earnable
[p]was delivering rapid results. The whole program — from “quick wins” videos to instant access to the whole program to the whole structure of the training — is designed to get you from “no idea” to “first sale” as fast as possible. Then, to show you how to scale up your business rapidly.
[p]If you’re deliberate, methodical, and follow the action steps, you will see results. And looking back, 1-2 years from now, the amount of time you invested will pale in comparison to the recurring rewards you’re accruing — just like with my first $4.95 product that, years later, still continues to sell.
[h4]MENTAL BARRIERS AND DOUBTS
[h6]"Ugh, I don't want this to become yet another thing on my to-do list."
[b]The last thing we need is another to-do item to make us feel guilty.
[i]Earnable
[p]isn’t a brain dump of business tactics. It’s a complete, efficient SYSTEM for going from nothing to a working, successful business. You can make progress with 5 minutes a day during your morning coffee run. And we include specific productivity material to show you all the ways you can integrate this into your day. Don’t focus on the worst that could happen — focus on the best that could happen once you use it.
[h6]"What if I fall behind?"
[b]Don’t worry — I understand that sometimes, life gets in the way.
[i]Earnable
[p]includes lifetime access so you can take a break from the material if you’re out of town, on vacation, or just swamped for a few days. Pause and resume whenever you need to.
[h6]"What if I live in Europe (or somewhere else)?”
[b]Yes,
[i]Earnable
[b]will help you.
[p]We tested it with people around the world until they found success.
[h4]"IS EARNABLE RIGHT FOR ME?"
[h6]“What if I try Earnable, and I decide it isn’t right for me?”
[b]I stand by this course with a 60-day, 100% money-back guarantee.
[p]Because we extensively tested it, I know the course works, so I can take on the risk myself. Try the entire course for 60 days, and THEN decide if it’s right for you.
[p]However — and this is important — only join if you intend to follow the action steps. This course is not simply to consume information. It’s designed for you to take action. If you ask for a refund, we will require you to show us you completed the work.
[h6]“Is this course right if I want to create a physical product? Sell my services? Will it cover software/apps, and affiliate marketing?”
[i]Earnable
[b]is designed to help you succeed in sharing your passion and expertise with the world.
[p]We show you how to find paying clients, whether that’s 1-on-1, group, or online.
[i]Earnable
[p]will show you how to take your expertise and package it up to sell it online, without the frustrations, expenses, and hassles of physical distribution. My team and I have tested this process in 50+ different industries and with multiple price points and formats.
[p]I can teach you how to turn your knowledge into products that your customers will be delighted to pay for.
[i]Earnable
[p]will also show you how to earn tens of thousands via online consulting. Even if you don’t consider yourself a teacher or consultant.
[p]But I won’t be focusing on apps, physical products, or affiliate marketing, because for most students, it isn’t nearly as profitable, scalable, and maintenance-free as consulting and online products are.
[h4]HOW EARNABLE WORKS
[h6]"Is this course live?"
[b]The heart of
[i]Earnable
[b]is our comprehensive collection of Playbooks.
[p]When you join, you get immediate online access to all of the Playbooks so you can get started right away. No travel required.
[i]Earnable
[p]also includes full recordings of eight Business Makeovers with Ramit. Watch Ramit analyze real student businesses and answer tricky business questions on the spot. All of this is recorded and ready for you, whenever you want it, inside
[i]Earnable.
[span]If you join the
[i]Earnable Live
[span]tier, you will ALSO be invited to join our hands-on weekly group sessions. These structured sessions will guide you through the trickiest parts of starting a business, offering instant feedback and accountability.
[p]You’ll get free access to these and all future cohorts.
[p]You will ALSO be invited to join live monthly online workshops – hosted by me. These online workshops are LIVE deep dives, teardowns, and Q&As. Recording of the events will be shared with
[i]Earnable Live
[p]students in case anyone is unable to attend.
[span]The exact dates and times of the
[span]Earnable Live
[span]workshops will be shared with students upon joining.
[h6]"How much time does it take to do this course per week?"
[b]5-10 hours per week.
[p]The more time you put in, the faster you’ll see results. 5 hours is my recommendation, but because
[i]Earnable
[p]comes with lifetime access, you can go faster or slower if you want.
[h6]"Is there a community of
[i]Earnable
[h6]students I can connect with?"
[b]If you join the
[i]Earnable Live
[b]tier – yes!
[p]Once you join
[i]Earnable Live
[p], you’ll be invited to participate in the
[i]Earnable
[p]community with Ramit, IWT staff, and all of the
[i]Earnable Live
[p]students.
[p]This is a great way to get feedback on your work, boost your motivation, and meet fellow business owners. (The core tier of
[i]Earnable
[p]does not include access to the community.)
[h6]"Why just 50 seats for
[i]Earnable Live
[h6]?"
[p]Most online programs take as many people as possible.
[em]We don’t.
[p]We
[em]cap
[p]each cohort at 50 students — because we
[strong]go deep
[p]with each student inside our coaching sessions, Slack channel, and monthly workshops.
[span]And yes —
[strong]Earnable Live students are invited back
[span]for future sprints.
[p]Returning students bring a powerful edge to the room:
[p]They’ve been in the trenches.
[p]They’ve launched. Failed. Won. Tweaked.
[p]They
[em]help raise the bar
[p]for everyone — especially first-timers.
[p]Meanwhile,
[em]new students get our full attention
[p]because we’re not juggling hundreds of people.
[span]The level of hands-on support you get doesn’t scale to hundreds.
[p]That balance is exactly why this works. And it’s why spots go fast — and stay gone.
[b]Now I understand how to do it again.
[p]I can keep replicating this success with other products I want to release. I can create bigger products and price them higher. When you think of it that way, it’s really invaluable to have this kind of knowledge.”
[h6]PAULA RIZZO
[h3]Yes! You have other options
[p]We’ve already seen that
[i]Earnable
[p]works. The systems, strategies, and tactics you’ll get inside
[i]Earnable
[p]have been proven over 15+ years, 50+ industries, and 42,000+ paying customers.
[p]What would it cost for you to learn this yourself? I like to be candid with all your options, so you’re fully informed.
[b]Get an MBA?
[p]That’s $150,000, all in, from a top-tier school. You’ll learn deep theory about management, organizational psychology, and accounting, but you will not learn the nuts and bolts of starting a business online. Certainly not one that’s built to PAY YOU to live the life of your dreams.
[b]Hiring a business coach
[p]? $18,000 ($3K/month x 6 months). There are some superb business coaches out there, but also many quacks. How do you tell the difference? What if you don’t get results? Unfortunately, almost no business coaches offer money-back guarantees. You’re stuck choosing from a sea of unproven coaches with no safety net. And you’ll pay many times the cost of
[i]Earnable
[p].
[b]Try to start an online business by yourself?
[p]You could certainly learn this on your own. It took me 10+ years, cost millions of dollars in testing and mistakes (no joke). Not to mention spending tens of thousands of dollars buying hundreds of courses and books.
[p]For example, if you look in my online bookmarks, you’ll see 1,000+ bookmarks covering copywriting, optimization, testing, customer research, and marketing. And for every article I bookmarked, I read 100 other articles that didn’t make the cut. That’s 100,000 articles read, conservatively, over 15 years. You could do this, too — plus years of trial and error and hundreds of dead ends, to eventually crack the code of online business — hopefully. (Wouldn’t you rather just learn from someone who already did all that work and shortcut the process by YEARS?)
[b]Do nothing?
[p]The most haunting choice of all. When I asked my readers how long they’ve been talking about an online business, some said, 1 year, 5 years, and even “more than 10 years.” How much longer will you wait? How many excuses will you create? If not now, then when?
[h4]When I started an online business, I would have done anything to get the
[u]exact roadmap
[h4]to follow
[p]Instead of meandering around aimlessly at first, and trying everything under the sun, I would have given anything to learn from someone else who’d already been there and done it.
[p]Someone who’s…
[span]Repeatedly
[b]vetted by trusted outlets:
[b]Launched over 20 successful products
[span]from $49 to $12,000
[span]Earned a reputation for getting
[b]quantifiable results for students from all over
[span]the globe (of all ages). Then VERIFIED them and shared their successes
[span]Mastered how to
[b]build business systems to automate income —
[span]so your business can keep earning you money even if you take a day off, a week, or even a month
[span]Doesn’t race out crappy products but invests years and millions of dollars to create
[b]best-in-class, students-for-life level programs
[span]And of course, stands by everything he does with an
[b]iron-clad, powerful guarantee...
[h4]Try Earnable for a full 60-days, 100% risk-free
[h6]Try the entire Earnable program. If you don't LOVE it, I insist that you get 100% of your money back.
[p]I’ll even eat the credit-card processing fees.
[h6]Let me tell you exactly why I offer this unbeatable guarantee.
[p]When I researched
[i]Earnable
[p], I tried all of the popular courses in this area only to find that they regurgitated more of the same old, rehashed, generic info, focused on minutiae and tactics. Most of the “experts” had only ever launched one course — and it was about teaching other people how to launch courses!
[p]That’s not good enough for me, for IWT, or for my readers.
[p]Here’s exactly why I know
[i]Earnable
[p]is worth every penny and will help you start and grow your own business:
[b]– I invested years and over $1,000,000 of my own money
[p]into developing my system for starting and growing your own business.
[p]– I invited people from across the country, created all-new curriculum, tested it, hired top-tier video talent, and put together
[b]the best lessons anywhere.
[p]– Then I
[b]tested the whole course from beginning to end with thousands of students
[p]— many who started with no idea what business they could create or even how to set up a website. International students. Men. Women. Experienced entrepreneurs and total beginners.
[b]– My system worked. But I didn’t stop there.
[p]I kept refining, streamlining, and improving the systems I was teaching. I collected hundreds of thousands of data points and I personally spoke with thousands of students at every step of the process.
[p]– Then we pulled out everything that was even remotely confusing or difficult and rebuilt it from scratch. We iterated and tested all over again to make the
[i]Earnable
[p]system as
[b]fast and effective as possible
[p]. Rapidly find your idea, your first paying client, and scale up from there.
[p]– We also
[b]doubled down on everything that worked
[p]: simpler systems, more powerful strategies, more word-for-word scripts, more teardowns, more behind-the-scenes insights.
[p]– We collected “how they did it” case studies from students who are
[i]verified
[b]6-figure earners
[p]. Those got added to the program for you.
[p]– We added a
[u]robust community
[p],
[u]a 5-week sprint with live group sessions
[p], and
[u]monthly coaching
[p]to the
[i]Earnable Live
[p]tier to give you fast feedback and ongoing encouragement.
[p]All of this is why I KNOW that
[i]Earnable
[p]works.
[p]I only care about developing super high-quality programs full of proven strategies, systems, psychological tactics, scripts, and more that you can’t find anywhere else.
[p]That’s why my blog has been around for 15+ years and hosts over 850,000 readers per month.
[p]That’s why my book is a New York Times bestseller.
[p]That’s why my Netflix show is a must-watch.
[p]And that’s why I guarantee
[i]Earnable
[p].
[p]It’s simple: Take the course and see for yourself. If it doesn’t work, I want you to email me, prove you did the work, and I’ll refund you 100%.
[i]Earnable
[p]is designed as a lifetime investment, not just a program you take once and never look at again. It’s not a subscription. Once paid in full,
[b]it’s yours forever
[p]. We’ve had students use
[i]Earnable
[p]over and over again throughout the years to continue growing their businesses in new ways.
[p]This guarantee is extended for a full 60 days, which is more than enough time to go through every Playbook. Try the ENTIRE program. If you don’t love it, just email me at ANY TIME during the first 60 days and show me you’re doing the exercises and not getting results. I’ll refund 100% of your price.
[p]By the way, I ask you to show me you’ve done the exercises because I know how powerful they can be when applied. I have no intention of keeping your money if you’re dissatisfied, but I insist that you commit to taking action if you want the results from this program. I’ve spent millions developing the material in here, and I’d like to share it with you if you’re ready to use this material to build a business, make your first sale, then “scale” it for automatic, ongoing income — and the lifestyle you want.
[p]Remember, Earnable is an investment in your future that’s meant to last a lifetime.

[h2]The tragedy of mediocrity
[p]How long have you been thinking about starting a business?
[p]How many blog posts do you read every week?
[p]How many photos have you seen scroll by on your IG feed of friends traveling in the middle of the week, posting beach pictures while you’re sitting in a cubicle under fluorescent lights?
[p]It’s sobering to realize that right now, at this very moment, we have the most free time we’ll ever have.
[p]And instead of taking action, most of us just dream about a better life…someday.
[p]Instead of grabbing our barriers by the throat and shoving them in a trash can, we let them claw their way into our psyches and hold us back.
[p]When I asked, 96% of my readers told me they want to start an online business. So why don’t we?
[p]You already know it’s not the information alone. Most of the information is out there! Waiting another month to figure it out won’t change anything. If information alone were enough, you would have already done it.
[p]Next Monday, you’ll be facing another day of work. Another commute. Another week of doing some task that, 10 years from now, you won’t even remember.
[p]What’s the point of the work you’re doing? Here, let me show you: Fast forward a few years. Will that email you’re agonizing over matter? Will that meeting with your boss? Will you be one of the millions of people wondering why their 2% raises don’t make a difference?
[strong]Will you still be worried about money?
[p]Will you still feel miles away from taking a dream vacation, paying off your student debt, buying a dream home, or just enjoying a weekday that is genuinely, completely YOURS?
[p]Sometimes, we need a little nudge from someone who believes in us more than even we believe in ourselves. Someone who can encourage us, guide us — someone who’s been there. So that years from now, looking back on our lives, we don’t look back with regret and confess, “I wish I’d believed in myself enough to try that. I wish I’d at least tried.”
[p]I believe in you.
[p]I believe in you because I’ve helped thousands of people like you start their own businesses and start living their own Rich Lives — even when they didn’t think it was possible.
[b]I also believe tomorrow will be just like today unless YOU make a change.
[p]You may not know all the steps to go from where you are today to your Rich Life. And that’s OK. That’s what
[i]Earnable
[p]can help you with.
[p]The most important step you take is the next one, the one right in front of you.
[b]In just a few minutes, you could be part of an ambitious, encouraging community of fellow business owners.
[p]Or you could be stuck where you are now.
[b]In just a few days, you could have finally found your profitable business idea and tested it to know it’s a winner.
[p]Or you could be sitting at work, wondering “What if…?” Kicking yourself for not taking that chance.
[b]In a couple weeks, you could have already finished our 10 DAY SPRINT and closed your first sale. (How would you celebrate?)
[p]Or you could cut back on lattes to save a few bucks.
[b]In a few months, you could be using all of the step-by-step systems in the
[i]Earnable
[b]Playbooks to refine your offer, find more customers, and start scaling your business — faster than you thought possible.
[p]Or you could be sitting there, wondering if you’ll ever discover “the secret” to making more money.
[p]In your life, you only face a handful of truly life-changing choices. (And very, very few of them come with 60-day, 100% money-back guarantees.)
[p]If you’re ready, this choice can change your life.
[p]It can give you a life of freedom, of possibility, and growth.
[p]But only you can make the decision.
[p]Only you know if it’s time.
[p]If you’ve read this far, I suspect it’s time to make a change.
[h4]"My side hustle idea went from paying my rent to supporting a team"
[p]“I signed up for
[em]Earnable
[p]with the hopes of creating a side hustle that would cover my rent.
[b]Seven years later, I’ve sold that company and am starting a new chapter
[p].
[span]“Prior to joining
[i]Earnable
[span], I had no experience in online business…
[span]A few years after starting, I built an online subscription product which led to making my business my full-time job and hiring employees. In addition to that, I wrote a cookbook, cooked on TV news segments, hosted live classes and events, and partnered with some of my favorite brands.
[b]At the time, I couldn’t believe my side hustle idea went from paying my rent to supporting a team.

[h4]"Just did whatever we wanted for six whole weeks."
[p]“I took my wife and two-year-old daughter on a 6.5 week trip to Spain this past summer. I can work from anywhere on earth and have outsourced many of my day-to-day responsibilities so we just picked up and went.
[p]“We got a beautiful Airbnb in Valencia and just did whatever we wanted for six whole weeks. We ate out every single night, went to the beach most days, ordered appetizers and wine for dinner, took naps, and explored the city.
[strong]It was an absolute blast.
[p]In addition, I set a somewhat unconventional goal for my trip. I was never going to charge my laptop over the course of the entire trip. So whatever work I had to do would need to be done on whatever battery life I had – and I was able to do it with plenty of battery to spare!”

[h2]You’re one step away from changing your life
[p]We have the greatest opportunity in the history of the world in front of us — the internet, which lets us skip the gatekeepers, rapidly understand what people want, and go directly to the market!
[p]Yes, it’s confusing. Of COURSE it’s a little overwhelming. But it’s SUPPOSED to be hard.
[p]When handed a map to navigate towards greatness, will you take it? Or will you get around to it “later” — and let the greatest opportunity fall away?
[p]What a shame to stay stagnant. What a shame to let our dreams pass us by, and one day, to realize our best years are behind us.
[p]Now, if this course is genuinely not for you, I respect that.
[p]But if it is — if you really want a business, and you know there’s something inside of you that you’ve been waiting to share with the world — it’s time to decide.
[p]If you’re ready to invest in yourself and start a business, don’t wait for “someday.” Don’t wait for the magic day when you suddenly have time, or a business idea falls from the sky.
[p]You have the proof that my material works. You’ve seen results from men, women, international students, beginners, experienced entrepreneurs, and people just like you.
[p]If not now, then when? If not this course, then is there anything that will really change your mind?
[p]The decision is up to you.
[p]As always, a year from now, you’re going to be a year older. Will you be living the life you want?
