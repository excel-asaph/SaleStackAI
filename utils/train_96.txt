[h1]Forget about the
[span]“hacks,”
[h1]the
[span]morning routines,
[h1]the
[span]random tactics
[p]What if you could START and FINISH every day
[span]confident, focused, motivated,
[p]and
[span]optimistic?
[p]What if you could stop worrying about everything that could go wrong…and start making things go right?
[p]What if you could stop reacting to everyone else…and start building the life you really want?
[h2]Featured in
[h4]Hi, I'm Ramit Sethi, the New York Times best-selling author and CEO of I Will Teach You To Be Rich.
[p]I send about 6 million emails every month — and at the bottom of most of them, I ask people to reply directly to me. Over the last 13+ years, I’ve read about 2,000 per day from readers like you.
[p]I hear from a lot of amazing people in my inbox — people who are earning more, living their Rich Lives, and giving back to their families and communities.
[p]Yeah, there’s the occasional nutjob (which I love), b
[span]ut mostly, it’s normal people sharing their story and looking for a little help.
[p]When I first started getting these emails, I never realized how open people would really be. I’d wake up, open my inbox, and start reading emails…
[p]…about acrimonious divorces, people feeling trapped in their lives, and the frustration of not knowing how to find a better job.
[p]Funny enough, on the same days I’d get those emails, I’d also get thank-you emails from other people, who’d casually mention that they used my material to negotiate a $30,000 raise or they finally paid off all their debt, 3 years early.
[p]Hmm. Some people were complaining they couldn’t find a job or launch a business…while others were routinely getting $30,000 bonuses and launching 6-figure businesses. Interesting.
[p]It was like I had a little window into the personal lives of millions of people. Lots of people were facing tough situations — but some people seemed to react totally differently than others.
[p]And I became obsessed in studying what makes the successful people master their situations…while other people just get stuck.
[p]Ahh, getting stuck — one of the unspoken problems of our generation. You know people like this, trapped with too many options, paralyzed with what to do. I know people who’ve been spinning their wheels on the same problem for years.
[p]Look, I could tell you about all the odd things these people do, like how they tell everyone around them about their goals, set these big, ambitious New Year’s resolutions, and then week by week, they start quietly saying things like “life got in the way.”
[p]I could tell you how they gradually stop bringing it up in conversations. They used to get excited about what they were going to do, but now when friends ask about how it’s going, they just change the topic.
[p]But I’d rather just show you.
[p]Here’s an email I recently got:
[p]Nice! Helping people get healthy is a great goal, so I asked Taylor what his plan was.
[p]Wait, what? YEARS of thinking about it?
[p]But actually doing NOTHING?
[p]Major red flag.
[p]This story felt very familiar. I searched my inbox for Taylor’s name and found this wasn’t the first time he’d emailed me. A year before he sent this:
[p]This guy has literally spent YEARS dreaming and stressing about the same thing — and made absolutely zero progress.
[p]And he’s not alone! This is a real problem that almost nobody talks about. Notice how it can become addictive to talk about future plans (people love hearing the ambition). After a while, it almost seems like talking about our plans is just about as good as doing them.
[p]But deep down, we know it’s not. In quiet times alone, when we take a candid look at how many weeks it’s been — weeks, then months, then years — we beat ourselves up, resigned to wanting something but not being able to figure out why we can’t motivate ourselves to do it.
[p]I see it every single day. I’m talking about smart people who genuinely want something, but they can’t seem to make it happen. A new job. To lose weight. To start a business, or move cities, or find an amazing relationship…or just have the confidence to set boundaries in your personal life.
[p]Try to imagine the stages someone goes through when they’re stuck like this, for years.
[h2]The 10 stages of being stuck
[h3]STAGE 1
[h4]Motivation
[p]“I know I can do this…I’m pumped up”
[h3]STAGE 2
[h4]Minor deviation
[p]“I’m busy this week, but I’ll start next week”
[h3]STAGE 3
[h4]Socialization
[p]“You guys, I’m going to do this…it will be awesome”
[h3]STAGE 4
[h4]Reality settling in
[p]“Ugh, this is harder than I thought”
[h3]STAGE 5
[h4]Re-motivation
[p]“OK, I just watched this awesome YouTube video…I’m going to buckle down now”
[h3]STAGE 6
[h4]Bargaining
[p]“I made good progress yesterday, so I can skip today”
[h3]STAGE 7
[h4]Doubt
[p]“I keep saying I want this, but maybe I really don’t”
[h3]STAGE 8
[h4]Embarrassment
[p]“I’m so stupid, why can’t I do this? I’ve tried everything”
[h3]STAGE 9
[h4]Denial
[div]“I didn’t really want this anyway”
[h3]STAGE 10
[h4]Resignation
[div]“I’m never going to do this”
[p]Do you know anyone like this?
[p]Now a tougher question. When have you done this?
[p]Come on, don’t be shy.
[p]It’s easy to look at other people and scoff. I’m guilty of this too! But let’s talk about you.
[p]When have you let your own habits, or your inner critic, hold you back from something you really want? Goals you set, plans you made, promises you proclaimed…but even though you really wanted it…it just didn’t happen.
[strong]Getting stuck happens to smart people.
[p]This happens to successful people, not just lazy lumps. There are people who are good at their jobs, have solid careers, a good group of friends…and then hit an invisible ceiling and can’t figure out how to keep growing. People who get good but never quite make it to great.
[p]Why do some people plateau so early? Why do some people get stuck?
[p]And how do others seem to keep stacking success on success until their accomplishments, work, and lives feel completely unattainable (yet we know they started in the same place we did)?
[h3]“Maybe I'm missing something”
[p]I became obsessed figuring out the difference between the people who were emailing me, stuck on some problem for years…
[p]…and the people who seemed to sail by, racking up success after success.
[p]What was the difference? Was it about habits? Mindset? Were some people just born more ambitious or disciplined than others?
[p]I started emailing back with thousands and thousands of people. I asked my super-successful friends how they made it — painstaking details about how they built successful businesses, navigated tough career moves, handled bad bosses (and learned from good ones), and basically navigated the game of life.
[p]Here’s one thing that surprised me.
[p]Most people faced a challenge and got stuck, spinning their wheels.
[p](Notice what I said — MOST. I’d assumed that some people had self-doubt, or were nervous about making the wrong decision. It turns out
[span]everyone
[p]faced those challenges.)
[p]Winners faced the
[span]same
[p]challenges, but they focused on solutions. They may not have gotten it right the first time, but to their credit, they didn’t just wallow — they acted. That was one of the key distinctions between the people who plateaued and the people who kept succeeding.
[p]I found this profoundly surprising. Everyone faces challenges: financial, relationship, career, all kinds. But some people get stuck, and others push through. You saw that guy’s email above. He didn’t know what to do, so he got stuck. FOR YEARS.
[p]Sure, some people look for answers. What are the usual “solutions” people seek out? For a lot of people, they begin looking for the perfect morning ritual…or search through hundreds of sites to find the “right” green tea for energy…or obsess over productivity apps. (Know anyone like this?)
[p]Hey — at least they’re looking for answers. But the heartbreaking thing is that they genuinely believe if they find the “right” app then all their problems will disappear and they’ll be able to nail that goal they’ve wanted for years.
[p]You and I need to know better. We know they’re playing the wrong game entirely.
[p]The honest truth:
[span]They could get the perfect morning routine…and nothing would change
[span]They could find the perfect green tea…and nothing would change
[span]They could get the perfect productivity app…and nothing would change
[p]No matter how good your sleep is, no matter how many productivity systems you have, life’s problems aren’t going away. You and I will always face them.
[p]In fact, the older you get, the more challenges life will throw at you: family, career, elderly parents, money, and unexpected life decisions.
[p]Some people get stuck and plateau. They never recover.
[p]Meanwhile, the most successful people are quietly playing a completely different game.
[h3]The secret skill of
[i]Mental Mastery
[p]My trainer once told me something I’ll never forget.
[h4]“I want you to be able to walk into any gym, anywhere, and be able to walk up and do anything that someone in that gym is doing.”
[p]You know those moments when you hear something you know you’ll remember forever? I felt that chill going down my arms. Man, I loved it. I loved the aspiration of what he was saying — that I could go into any gym, any time, lift as much as anyone else, and just fit right in.
[p]In other words, I would be good enough to depend on myself, anywhere.
[p]This idea is so much bigger than just lifting weights.
[p]A friend texts me to go kayaking? “Sure, I’ll see you in an hour.”
[p]I realize we have to build a financial model? “OK, I can do that.” (Never done it before? Not a problem. “I can figure it out.”)
[p]Some person at work is making crazy demands? “I can handle it. I’ve set boundaries before and I can do it again.”
[strong]This is
[i]Mental Mastery
[strong]— the set of deep inner skills that give winners their edge.
[i]Mental Mastery
[p]is:
[span]Having the confidence to know what you want
[span]The motivation to keep pushing, even when times get tough
[span]The focus to know what to spend time on — and what to ignore
[span]And the optimism to know it will all work out…and to have fun doing it!
[p]You and I will always face challenges. Most people try to fix the symptoms — productivity apps for sleep, get-rich-quick investments for money, supplements for health.
[p]But when I talked to successful people, none of them talked about apps or hacks or supplements. Not a single one. It wasn’t that they had a secret hack they were keeping secret. They almost didn’t care. The hacks didn’t matter.
[p]Instead, they dove right into the psychology behind their choices — from how they responded to tough times, to knowing when to push hard and when to go with the flow.
[p]Imagine someone successful you admire.

[p]When you imagine them walking into a room, is their head filled with doubt? If something bad happens to them, do they rush online to look for a productivity app?
[p]Of course not. If you boil down their success, their ability to control their lives instead of reacting or just treading water like so many people — it’s their Mental Mastery that makes the difference. Mental Mastery outweighs any tactic on earth.
[p]That’s why I want you to focus on what really matters. Forget hacks. Get off the productivity treadmill. If you focus on Mental Mastery, you’re in charge.
[h3]Jim Rohn once said:
[h4]“Don't wish it was easier wish you were better. Don't wish for less problems wish for more skills. Don't wish for less challenge wish for more wisdom.”
[p]I love that. He knew that the world will continue to give us bigger and bigger challenges. Instead of wishing for them to go away, we should build the skills to tackle each and every one of them.
[p]As I’ve worked to develop Mental Mastery, my business has grown to dozens of people, 50,000+ customers, and millions of dollars in revenue. At work, situations that would have destroyed me 3 years ago are just a normal Tuesday for me now.
[p]Oh, a key person left? 3 years ago I would have been devastated and wondering how we would go on. Now, I feel bad for an hour and then I get back to work. I can handle this.
[p]Our site traffic took a hit with a Google algorithm update? That sucks, but it’s fine. Now I have the Mental Mastery to know I’ll still be here tomorrow, we can figure it out, and we’ll make it.
[p]When I look back at my business success, it wasn’t from learning some fancy-schmancy tactic about email marketing. Tactics come and tactics go. It was building the Mental Mastery to stay strong, optimistic, confident, and focused on what I wanted.
[p]I know I can’t control the ocean, but I can be a better swimmer. And so can you.
[h2]5 differences between Mental Masteryand an ordinary life
[p]Look at the striking differences between Mental Mastery and an ordinary life. Which approach do you want to use in your life?
[h3]ON CHALLENGES
[span]MOST PEOPLE:
[p]“How am I supposed to get ahead when I’m so busy / I keep getting distracted by new stuff / my boss keeps giving me last-minute work / I don’t have enough money? It must be nice to be able to focus on one thing. But something always comes up for me.”
[span]PEOPLE WITH MENTAL MASTERY:
[p]“I used to think that once I made it, I wouldn’t face these kinds of challenges. But now I realize that the more successful I am, the more challenges I’ll face — bigger, tougher ones. But I can become stronger to handle each and every one of them. I know I can do it because I’ve done it in the past and I’ll do it in the future.”
[h3]ON TACTICS
[span]MOST PEOPLE:
[p]“I just need to find the right morning routine, then I can finally get everything done. I have 32 success podcasts on my phone that I’m going to listen to — I know one of them is going to help me get motivated.”
[span]PEOPLE WITH MENTAL MASTERY:
[p]“I don’t give a shit about motivation. I build habits. Tactics are fun, but I’m going to build up the habit — day in and day out — so I can depend on myself, not motivation that strikes randomly. It doesn’t matter if it’s raining or shining or I’m tired. This is important to me.”
[h3]ON TALENT
[span]MOST PEOPLE:
[p]“I’ve tried so many different projects, business ideas, new skills and they all fizzle out. For some reasons, it just never works out. I don’t know. Maybe I’m not as smart as I thought…”
[span]PEOPLE WITH MENTAL MASTERY:
[p]“Lots of other people have done it — people who won’t work as hard, people who won’t put as much time in. If they can do it, I can do it. I’m talented enough. It’s just a matter of time and hard work.”
[h3]ON EFFORT
[span]MOST PEOPLE:
[p]“I already work hard. What else am I supposed to do? I don’t have any more hours in the day.”
[span]PEOPLE WITH MENTAL MASTERY:
[p]“Every one of us has the same amount of hours in the day. How do other people do it? What can I learn from the best? How many hours does Elon Musk work every day? And what can I apply to my life so I can focus on the things that are important to me?”
[h3]ON GETTING STARTED
[span]MOST PEOPLE:
[p]“I don’t know where to start. There’s so much different advice out there. It’s overwhelming.”
[span]PEOPLE WITH MENTAL MASTERY:
[p]“There are so many exciting things I want to do. The common denominator is ME. I have the confidence to pick one and go all in. If it doesn’t work, that’s fine — I’ll just move on to the next. I believe in myself and my habits to follow through, even when it gets hard.”
[p]This is the unspoken, hidden game of Mental Mastery that allows winners to keep winning while everyone else — even smart, talented people — get stuck and don’t even know why.
[p]It took me years of work, research, networking, and sheer trial-and-error to discover the 4 deep, inner skills that separate winners from everyone else. The skills that give winners the rare edge we all crave.
[p]Yes, skills. Because Mental Mastery can be taught, practiced, and perfected.
[p]How come nobody talks about this? The short answer is: It doesn’t sell. The vast majority of people are looking for tactics for “rapid weight loss” and “quick money.”
[p]But a small group of people don’t want to focus on tactics. They know the one thing in common with all Top Performers is their Mental Mastery.
[p]Most people seek out Mental Mastery because they realize the hacks and routines won’t solve their problems. Are you sick and tired of:
[span]Still fighting the same challenges you were 3 years ago?
[span]Having trouble setting boundaries?
[span]Complaining about “motivation” over and over…until you can’t even stand hearing yourself say it?
[p]Mental Mastery changes everything — it lets you play a completely different game. In fact, instead of just overcoming those problems…
[p]…you’ll discover that you can use Mental Mastery to go from good to great.
[span]Become mentally and emotionally strong
[span]Be confident enough to speak up for yourself — at work, at home, and anywhere
[span]Follow through on what you say you will — become a “do-er,” not a “talker”
[span]Learn how to translate “stress” into “calm”
[p]Top Performers do it. Now you can too.

[h2]The difference between winners — and everyone else
[p]What do Top Performers do differently? How do they think and act when they face situations that would trip others up?
[i]Mental Mastery
[strong]is an inside look at how the best are absolutely the best…
[span]How to develop unwavering focus — the #1 competitive advantage in our age of never-ending social media distraction
[span]Why you should ignore 99% of productivity advice you read online. It’s not just a waste of time — it’s hurting you! I’ll show you why being a winner has NOTHING to do with morning routines or productivity hacks
[span]A simple reframe that lets you stop worrying about being “productive” and actually start getting shit done
[span]“Cloud level” motivation vs. “street level” motivation. Why it’s CRITICAL you understand the difference if you care about your happiness and productivity
[span]Why your goals are holding you back. That’s right, I’ll show you how to jumpstart your motivation (in under 10 minutes) by throwing away your loftiest ambitions
[span]How to beat perfectionism with the “stepping stone” principle (because sometimes the details truly don’t matter)
[span]Why Top Performers don’t care about efficiency… and what they really focus on to dominate in any situation
[span]When to embrace hard work… and when to take it easy
[span]How to accomplish in 2 days what would normally take 2 weeks
[span]Why most people struggle with self-discipline… and how to develop total control without beating yourself up (or burning yourself out)
[span]The #1 thing you can do now — starting TODAY — to practically guarantee success in any area of your life (whether that’s your job, your business, dating, or in the gym)
[span]How to control exactly how confident you feel in any situation

[span]How to confidently keep growing and changing… even when the world (your friends, family, even mentors) pressure you to stay the same
[p]And that’s just a sample of the insights packed into this course.
[h3]A new approach to Mental Mastery
[p]There are countless frameworks and “mental heuristics” out there.
[p]But in my years of reading millions of emails, speaking to successful friends, and building my own multimillion-dollar company, I learned a few simple rules of thumb.
[p]They were practical, easy to apply, and extremely powerful.
[p]Best of all, they were FUN.
[p]I don’t know about you, but I LOVE learning about myself, recognizing the patterns, then working to improve them. Sure, it’s work — but it’s amazing to watch yourself change from the inside out.
[p]In this course, I collected the very best tools and frameworks and shared them, along with specific stories. You can apply these instantly to your work, your personal life, and your business.
[p]These tools will help take you from good to great — and even one of these lessons can be worth its weight in gold.
[p]Put them together and you have a microscope to examine your own inner thoughts…and a roadmap for optimizing, improving, and skipping ahead. There’s nothing else like it.
[i]Mental Mastery
[h3]IS for you if…
[span]You’re open to admitting that the way you’ve acted in the past may need to change if you want to achieve higher levels of success and happiness
[span]You want to stop blindly trying the latest “schemes” for boosting your productivity and success and start emulating proven Top Performers
[span]You’re focused on the long term — and you understand there will always be ups-and-downs, but that you can make HUGE gains by acting smarter
[span]You’ve tried the “conventional advice” about habits, weight loss, and learning new skills, and they haven’t worked
[span]You’ve gotten as far as you can on your own, but you know “what got you here won’t get you there” — and you’re open to getting an extra push to cross the bridge to success
[h2]"What if I fall behind?"
[p]Don’t worry about falling behind — each video is distilled down to just the “bite-sized” essentials and includes specific examples so you can spend your time taking action instead of reviewing tons of content
[em]Mental Mastery
[p]also comes with lifetime access so you can take a break from the material if you’ll be out of town, on vacation, or just get swamped for a few days. You’ll have this resource for life. It will always be there when you’re ready.
[h2]"I don't want this to become yet another thing on my to-do list…"
[p]The last thing we need is another thing to juggle.
[em]Mental Mastery
[p]isn’t another set of to-dos you’ll have to force yourself to find extra time for. It’s not a band-aid or a workaround.
[em]Mental Mastery
[p]is a condensed, at-your-own-pace, transformational program that will show you how to develop deep psychological strength and the peak performance that goes with it.
[p]I recommend spending at least 3 hours a week on this course for maximum benefit. You can also download the material to listen to on your phone, or read the transcripts — whatever’s easiest for you. 3 hours is my guideline, but because it comes with lifetime access, you can go faster or slower if you want.
[h2]"How is
[i]Mental Mastery
[h2]different than Success Triggers and Finisher's Formula?"
[p]In short,
[em]Mental Mastery
[p]is focused on four key inner skills: confidence, motivation, focus and optimism.
[em]Success Triggers
[p]takes a broader look at the habits that drive success in your professional and personal life.
[em]Finisher’s Formula
[p]dives deep in to how to avoid procrastination and get things done. All three courses are designed to support each other and if you enjoy one of them we believe you will enjoy them all.
[h2]"How long will this course take?"
[p]This is a 30-day course. Each video is short and focused. We recommend watching one a day, and with lifetime access you can revisit them whenever you like.
[p]If you’re ready, you can learn the secret to unbreakable focus and motivation so you can calmly, consistently, successfully work through your goals. And from now on, whenever you’re feeling stuck in a rut or overwhelmed, you’ll have an ally with you for the rest of your life.

[p]I felt like I was hitting a plateau with my personal development and was having a lot of difficulty figuring out how to keep pushing through to the next level. The tools I learned from
[i]Mental Mastery
[p]have been invaluable in helping me identify my mental blocks and places of stagnation.
[h2]—Spencer Hinton
[div]One lesson has had a profound and instant impact on my life. It was the lesson where Ramit talked about challenging yourself on how fast things actually take. Instead of things taking two weeks, they could take three days!
[h2]—Nagina Abdullah (my sister)
[p]I tried for a very long time to wake up earlier and had plenty of struggles with it. With the hot-cold method from
[i]Mental Mastery
[p], I finally got into the habit of waking up early.
[h2]—Che Chengsupanimit
[p]Last night, while my two year old was crying endlessly because he left his stuffed sheep at his grandparents’ house, I used the “hot to cool” technique to stay calm, not get frustrated and just be there for him rather than having to walk away because I’m irritated.
[p]I literally sat there thinking, “Ok, hot emotion. I’m feeling frustrated that he won’t stop crying. What would ‘cool’ look like? Just being there, being level-headed, calm.”
[p]Just thinking about “choosing to stay cool” and going from hot to cool allowed me to stay there with him while he was (really) upset instead of just telling him to go to sleep and deal with it.

[p]made me realise that it is normal for things to go wrong. It’s your response that makes the difference. … I simply snatch my phone or go in person to set things right and don’t give up until I’ve succeeded. It’s actually fun, and I’ve gained a reputation for being very cool.
[h2]—Sabine Marschner
[div]I really love the concept of the “do now” and “do later” lists from the first couple of lessons. It has removed a lot of stress from my life and enabled me to focus more clearly on a few things that I can tangibly achieve.

[h2]Some people choose to be stuck.Others choose
[i]Mental Mastery
[h2].
[p]We spend most of our lives going through our toughest challenges alone.
[p]We see others’ successes and wonder how they did it.
[p]We feel guilty about our weight and diet.
[p]We resign ourselves to our social skills, never understanding that they are “skills” that can be systematically improved.
[p]And we settle for our jobs, our finances, even our lifestyle!
[p]Worst of all, we rarely share our struggles…since we’re “supposed” to know how to do these things on our own (right?).
[p]What I’ve learned is we don’t have to struggle through these challenges. In fact, if we JUST got help on the biggest 4-5 sticking points in our lives, we could soar by leaps and bounds.
[p]Most people go a lifetime chasing random tactics, becoming frustrated, and even giving up. Think about it — that’s DECADES of frustration.
[p]How many people do you know who let opportunity after opportunity sail by…even though they claim they want a better life?
[p]How many people do we know who are 40, 50, even 60 years old, who have destructive mental patterns?
[p]Now, fast forward in your own life: What if you did nothing differently today…and ended up like them tomorrow?
[p]Top Performers recognize the importance of mastering tactics, but they know that their mental strength is the one key that can never be taken away.
[p]Mental Mastery provides the ultimate leverage in finding success, wealth, and happiness.
[p]You don’t have to do this alone. I went through the painstaking process of discovering, distilling, and teaching these four essential components of mastering your mental game. They’ve helped me live a Rich Life, and I’d like to share the same with you.
[p]These aren’t one-time techniques you’ll use this week or next month. In fact, these aren’t “techniques” at all.
[p]These are the deep inner skills embodied by everyone who has “won” the game — in their careers, in their health, in their relationships. So it’s natural that you have lifetime access to this course — since I expect you’ll refer back to this now, 5 years from now, even 15 years from now.
[p]I created
[i]Mental Mastery
[p]as your “secret playbook” to improve your confidence, develop your focus, control your motivation, and engineer an optimistic outlook. You don’t have to tell anyone you joined the course. They’ll just notice your quiet confidence, the new way you carry yourself, and — when times get stressful — how calm you are.
[p]Nobody can ever take those away from you.
[p]Let’s take this journey together.
[p]A year from now, you’re going to be a year older. What are you going to do?
