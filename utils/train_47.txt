[h1]Why Millions Of People Sleep With Pain - And A Surprising New Solution
[small]2025-12-07
[p]Claire was in a car accident a few years ago.
[p]Unfortunately, it was more than your typical fender-bender.
[p]A drunk driver barreled into her lane, cut her off, and ultimately forced her vehicle into the median at sixty miles an hour. The smoking ruin and the twisted metal of her own car, shattered glass on the street, and the smell of burning oil are just a few of the things that have stuck with her over the years.
[p]Claire remembers the accident vividly. She reiterates how grateful she is to have walked away from the wreck, but she says she didn't go alone.
[p]"I started off the day just fine. Happy-go-lucky, care-free, whatever. Now, after the accident, I carry this pain with me. Chronic pain for years. I cannot sleep. It makes me," Claire sighs, "...it is the most difficult thing in my life. No sleep, more pills, more pain. No relief."
[p]Claire isn't alone in her pain, nor her inability to attain restful sleep.
[p]When the doctor introduced Claire to the possibility that surgery loomed on the horizon, she decided she'd had enough.
[p]"I will do no more
[b]surgeries.
[p]" She says fiercely. "No more. I make an appointment with the doctor and get a second opinion. I cannot live like this anymore. I need to sleep."
[p]Claire's second opinion took on a more holistic approach. Dr. Shiva has been making a name for herself in the local area over the last few years. She prides herself on helping patients recover from addictions and detox their bodies of heavy metals, alongside her daily work as a resident expert in the neurology department of the university.
[p]"I knew what we were dealing with, here," Dr. Shiva said, "and I knew exactly what to tell Claire. If you are worried about your pain, you must first worry about your sleep. If your body doesn't have rest...true, deep, REM-cycles throughout the night...you're going to have pain, especially at her age."
[p]Claire was one of the first people to try Dr. Shiva's
[a]Derila
[b]Foam Pillow.
[p]"At first," Claire reports, "I thought she was crazy. A pillow? What good will a pillow do for me? Dr. Shiva convinced me to try it for a week. I only try it for four, or five nights, and I knew she was right. By the end of the week, I was having the best night's sleep of my life!"
[p]Claire says she still deals with some pain from the accident, but for the first time in years, she's able to sleep through the night and wakes up refreshed every morning..
[p]Can a pillow really make that much of a difference in someone's life?
[p]"It can, and it does," Dr. Shiva tells us. "Whether you have chronic pain or not...whether you have migraines, headaches, insomnia, or just have trouble getting restful sleep, the
[a]Derila
[p]will work for you. My staff and I did extensive studies on the effects of back-sleepers versus side-sleepers, how much padding to use for the neck while sleeping, and so many things. All of these studies resulted in a pillow that is universally the best fit, size, shape, and thickness for everyone."
[h4]What Is It And How Does It Work?
[p]Are you tired of being so tired all the time?
[p]Sleep experts and neurology professionals will tell you, from their personal experiences. Sleep posture is one of the most overlooked key factors if a person is experiencing sleeping issues or aches and pains that keep them awake at night.
[a]Derila
[p]is the universal answer to sleeping issues helping people everywhere! The ergonomically shaped design keeps your head, neck, back, shoulders and spine aligned and the pressure evenly distributed,
[b]which helps you stay asleep throughout the night and wake up feeling completely rested.
[p]Comfort and support go hand-in-hand for the first time with
[a]Derila
[p]to provide therapeutic relief for back and side sleepers alike. Fall asleep faster. Dream deeper!
[p]The pillow material is 100% polyester for maximum breathability and is skin-friendly and chemical-free. Adequate heat distribution keeps you cool all night long and promotes better air circulation.
[h4]The
[a]Derila
[h4]has started to develop a cult following, and with over 10,000 5-star reviews, it makes sense. Here's what customers are saying about it:
[p]Derrick T. Verified Buyer
[p]I've tried just about every pillow on the market for relief from right clavicle-right shoulder pain which has plagued me for most of the year. Despite frequent swimming and doing yoga, and seeing the doc, it would not let up. Until I bought this pillow, nothing helped.
[p]After using it one night, I realized the next day how much better I was. Within a week, the problem literally disappeared. It has not returned It had been so bad that my clavicle was bent into another plane and was noticeably prominent. It is in alignment now.
[p]THANK YOU TO WHOEVER DESIGNED and MANUFACTURED THIS PILLOW and MADE IT AVAILABLE TO ME!!! YOU'LL NEVER KNOW HOW GRATEFUL I AM.
[p]Cathy B. Verified Buyer
[p]I have a rare disease that causes severe joint damage and as a result, I have a lot of neck and shoulder problems. This supports my head in any position I sleep in. I also appreciate that it doesn't have a strange chemical smell like foam pillows tend to have at first.
[p]Audrey H. Verified Buyer
[p]I felt obligated to write a review on this pillow. Used it for the first time last night and I couldn't believe how I slept. I purchased over 5 different pillows and nothing worked. It was horrible until this arrived. I was blown away when I woke up well-rested and absolutely NO PAIN. I was so happy and wanted to share it with you guys. I had an ACDF neck procedure and this pillow simply works as described. Nice packaging and very comfortable. The shoulder shape and cervical curve are PERFECT !. Trust me people you don't want to miss this one !! Looking to get another one for my mother!
[h4]After Claire's story, I wondered if the
[a]Derila
[h4]could help me, too.
[p]I've been a reporter for 27 years, which sounds more exciting than it is. Almost three decades of being on call all hours of the night to cover breaking stories are exciting, but it really does a number on my sleep quality.
[p]On top of that, I've been suffering from neck and back pain for the last few years, which I cope with by taking a copious amount of anti-inflammatories.
[p]Because of my personal situation, Claire's story resonated with me.
[p]I decided I needed to look into the
[a]Derila
[p]for myself.
[p]Once I saw the overwhelming number of positive reviews
[a]Derila
[p]was getting, I thought it was worth a try. I got on the official website and ordered 2 of them when they came back in stock, one for me and one for my husband.
[p]It never hurts to have a second opinion, after all.
[h4]...Here's What I Found.
[p]The
[a]Derila
[p]arrived at my door in just 2 days. I was surprised.
[p]Right out of the box, I knew I had made the right decision.
[p]This pillow makes a great first impression. It's firm but flexible. Soft, but durable. I could tell it was higher quality than I was used to, even more so than the name-brand ones I've purchased in the past.
[p]I'm a side-sleeper, and my husband is a back sleeper, so I figured we'd put the
[a]Derila
[p]through a pretty rigorous test over the next few nights.
[p]The pillow was cool and plush but offered a lot more stability than I expected. That first night, I was so comfortable as I drifted off, that I didn't really think a whole lot about it. When I woke up the next morning, I wasn't sure if I noticed a real difference or if it was all just in my head.
[p]By the third day, I knew it was real. I was sleeping a solid 6 hours (that's a lot for me, I average 4 hours a night), and my husband, king of beauty sleep, was getting 8 hours uninterrupted...and the craziest thing, he stopped snoring. Usually, it's like he's sawing logs all night, but with the
[a]Derila
[p], something about the way his head is positioned on the pillow really seemed to help him a lot.
[div]Before
[div]After
[p]Snore time reduced to 9 min from 2h 49m!
[p]On the fifth morning of using
[a]Derila
[p], my husband actually told me he hadn't slept that well in years.
[p]I believed him because my neck wasn't sore when I woke up that morning, and I could feel the tension in my shoulders starting to loosen. It was crazy because I was still working in my fast-paced journalism job and I hadn't changed anything-my eating habits were still the same, the amount of sleep I was getting was the same-the only difference was the pillow I was using.
[p]That was enough for me. I got back on the website and ordered a few more pillows because I wanted everyone in my family to have them.
[h4]UPDATE: 6 months with
[a]Derila
[h4], and I'm still sleeping GREAT!
[p]When you know something works, you come to rely on it, and I have definitely come to expect to wake to feel rested and with no neck and back pain. This is something I would have thought was impossible just 6 months ago, but I live it every blissful night now!
[p]My 73-year-old father thought the
[a]Derila
[p]I gave to him and my mother was hokey until my mother insisted on using it. When she started going on and on about how it was helping her fibromyalgia and arthritis in her neck, he decided to give it a try, too.
[p]I got a call from him a few days later thanking me.
[p]"I thought that
[a]Derila
[p]was just some gimmick you fell into, but I'll tell ya, it's really changed the way I sleep."
[p]Coming from my father, that's a resounding endorsement!
[p]I've had a life-changing experience with
[a]Derila
[p], and you can, too! If you're looking for the best night's sleep of your life, this is it. I don't ever spend a night in my home or anywhere without
[a]Derila
[p]!
[p]I can't recommend it enough!
[h4]How Much Does It Cost?
[p]It's currently on sale on their official website for just
[span]€ 39,95
[p]!
[h4]Is It Worth It?
[p]Of course! I'll always be using the
[a]Derila
[p]pillow to get the best night's sleep possible-at home and if I ever travel. I'm glad I have this simple and effective product to keep my neck and back feeling great and help me get the best out of the hours I spend sleeping.
[p]The benefits are well worth the one-time purchase!

[p]Nancy S.
[p]I have spent hundreds on specialty pillows and this one by far is the best!! I was skeptical when I unpacked it as it appears a bit flimsy and light but I have slept soundly each night for a week so far and bought 2 more!!
[p]Hellen L.
[p]An excellent shape; head and cervical spine come to rest; the neck pain is gradually saying goodbye! I have no hesitation in recommending this pillow! Thanks very much!
[p]Faye C.
[p]I`ve had many pillows where I`ve been told this is the best, but my head and neck disagreed. I`ve found the best with the Derila pillow. It`s ergonomic and skin-friendly, just great!
[p]Torey S.
[p]I really love my pillow. I experienced bad sleeping positions before, and headache and shoulderpains every day. Now- 4.day with my new pillow, I have slept like a baby and my pain is gone.
[p]Mandy L.
[p]The structure of the fitting is ideal, not too hard not too soft! i love the concept of reverse laying on the head cause it helps my neck out greatly! i’m gonna buy another one for my wife since she liked it too! great product !
