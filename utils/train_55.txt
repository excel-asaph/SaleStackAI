[b]“Two Comma Club” award-winning entrepreneurs would do to save themselves in 30 days, and get their business back on track…FOR FREE!
[div]From the desk of: Russell Brunson (co-founder of ClickFunnels)
[div]Boise, Idaho
[div]Dear Entrepreneur,
[h2]Recently, I asked 30 of my ‘Two Comma Club’ members (
[i]those who have generated over $1 Million+ inside their ClickFunnels funnel
[h2]) a very loaded question...
[i]You Suddenly
[u]LOSE
[b]EVERYTHING...
[div]You lose all your money, along with your name and reputation, and only have your marketing know-how left.
[div]You have bills piled high, and people harassing you for money over the phone.
[div]Plus, you have a guaranteed roof over your head, a phone line, an internet connection, and a ClickFunnels account for only one month.
[div]You no longer have your big guru name, your following, or JV partners. Other than your vast marketing experience,
[b]you're an unknown newbie.
[b]What Would You Do?
[b](From Day 1 To Day 30) If You Knew You Only Had ONE FUNNEL To Make Back Your Millions?”
[div]I didn’t know if anyone would
[i]actually
[div]respond to me or not…
[div](But I
[i]hoped
[div]they would…)
[div]Over the next few days responses started flooding my inbox...
[div]Each of them replied to my email not just with an answer, but with a
[u]brilliant
[div]detailed 30-day plan of what they’d do to get back on TOP.
[div]They broke their plan down
[b]day-by-day
[div]…
[b]“Day 1, I’d do this…
[b]Day 2, I’d do this…
[b]Day 3, I’d do this…”
[div]Each of them laid out a complete
[b]30 day battle plan
[div]to get their business back on track...starting back at “square one” with:
[b]No Product...
[b]​No List...
[b]​No Traffic...
[b]​No Reputation...
[b]​And
[i]NO
[b]Funnel
[div]I was so inspired by these amazing (and crazy DETAILED) plans, I knew I wanted to
[i]compile ALL OF IT somehow
[div], and get this into the hands of as many entrepreneurs as possible…
[div]I wanted a book of go-to online business plans, where EACH person’s plan was a different chapter...
[div]So I asked each of the award-winning entrepreneurs who responded -
[b]"Would you mind
[u]WRITING DOWN
[b]your 30-day plan, in detail, so that others can learn from you?"
[i]It was a big ask…
[div]Let’s face it...I
[i]knew
[div]it would require a decent amount of time and love for them to document their 30 Day blueprints, step by step…
[div]But sure enough, they all said YES!
[b]"30 Days" is a GIANT 550-page downloadable book
[div]of ALL their compiled battleplans (Day 1 through Day 30).
[div]30 chapters…
[div]30 different, unique action plans…
[div]You can actually go through the pages day-by-day, and SEE the “big picture” of their FUNNEL plan
[b]laid out right in front of you!
[div]You can page through, and reference it as you try out new business ideas...
[b]If you’re starting from scratch
[div](or starting
[i]again
[div]), with no name, no reputation, no list, no money, no traffic, and no product…
[div]Then this FREE downloadable book is for you!
[div]You’ll find not just
[i]ONE
[div], but 30 different award-winners’ plans for getting an online business off the ground, (or back on track) starting from the very beginning.

[b]Oh, and if you’re wondering...
[b]THERE IS NO CATCH
[div]I’ve witnessed so many marketers out there who offer you something awesome for free...only to trap you into some program that charges your card every month.
[div]And that’s just not my style.
[b]Why Am I Giving You This Book...FOR FREE?!
[div]A couple reasons, actually…
[div]1. Because (unlike other "gurus") I don't make all of my money teaching others how to make money (I actually run real businesses online selling software, supplements, physical products and more)... so because of that, it doesn't hurt me to share with you my best stuff.
[div]2. This is something I genuinely feel should be in the hands of
[u]every
[div]entrepreneur, no matter where they are at in their journey. It’s
[u]literally
[div]a giant vault of online business battle-plans from others who have taken their success to the ‘Two Comma Club’ and beyond.
[div]3. I get another one of my products in your hands, and when you see how awesome it is, it should get you excited to buy other stuff from me in the future. The more money I can make you now, the more likely you are to get curious and check out my other products and programs down the road.
[div]That’s it.
[i]That’s
[b]why I’m doing this.
