[div]#2 – 29 Day Implementation Blueprint to 100k Followers
[b]($4,997 Value)
[div]Now I don't know about you, but let me ask you this. If right now, one of your peers, your competitors, your audience members were to look you up, and if they found your Facebook page and they saw that you had a following of 100,000 people or more, do you think that would help you change your status or positioning in your marketplace?

[div]And I'm going to show an actual case study of my campaigns, the ads that I used, and the content I used which yielded a minimum of 9x ROI, so that you can model it and deploy it.

[div]None of these students have a campaign set up yet. I am showing them how to run the ads, the specific languaging behind it, the mistakes and the successes that I’ve had... so that you can model and see what works, and what does not work.

[b]So let me ask you a question…
[div]If Facebook Secrets Mastery, the framework, did everything that we've promised…
[b]completely revolutionizing your bottomline
[div]and your business…
[div]How much more money would you make on your next ad campaign if you had an extra 200 people looking at your offer, buying at a 10% conversion, which is 20 sales?
[div]How much is 20 extra sales worth to you?
[span]This obviously isn’t counting lifetime value of a customer,
[b]your own perceived value and status growth
[span]… the authority you would start to possess...
[div]Right now, what if (and this is a very realistic what if) you follow this program and had 20 winning ad campaigns…
[div]What If you multiplied that amount by 20?
[span]What if you made that consistently for an entire year just by accessing Facebook Secrets?
[div]Would it be worth paying $17,979, assuming you had the money?
[b]Would that be worth it?
[div]If you're able to not just run the winning ad campaigns, but build that following to over 100,000 people, 500,000 people, would it be worth $17,979?
[div]You can probably see why it's a great deal at $17,979.
[div]However, because I’m launching this product right now… the price will only be
[b]$1,997.
[span]Now, I know that this is an insane bargain…
[b]But I’m going to go one step further… just for you!
[div]The fact that you’ve read this far into the page… and ideally already watched the video… means you’re someone who takes action.
[b]You’re honestly the exact person I want in this course…
[span]So I’m going to offer you a deal.
[div]I’m willing to take $1000 off the already discounted launch price today… making this offer literally only
[b]$997
[div].
[div]I almost feel like I’m cheating myself here… but the fact is, all I'm asking of you is that when you become successful… when you use this system to build a huge following
[span]...
[span]when you start to run extremely profitable ads…
[div]All I'm asking of you is to give me a testimonial.

[b]Some Commonly Asked Questions
[b]Q: I'm completely new. Will this work for me?"
[font]A: 100% yes, and if anything at all, it'll be great because you haven't developed any bad habits yet. In fact, some of the hardest people for me to train are the people who already have their systems and think certain things should be done.
[font]So if you're completely 100% new, even if you don't have a Facebook page, I'll show you right from the start how you start creating this content, build afollowing, and run ads that serve an audience that's 100% organic, as well as paid.
[b]Q: "I've been doing Facebook for a while. How is this different?"
[font]A: What's totally different is this... Most Facebook Ad trainings talk about writing the ads, targeting the right people, monetizing, and retargeting, which is great, because it's so crucial in today's world, but that is just 50% of the equation. If you want to have an unfair advantage, you need to merge it with the other side of the equation, which is really how you build a following over time, so that you're building a brand, So that you're building something that is long-term. And when you merge and fuse two things together, that is how you get an unfair advantage. So that's the real reason why it's different. It's not just about running ads, it's also having that following, and having a synergy between those two things.
[b]Q: "Do I actually need this and how will this work for my business?"
[font]A: As long as your business is serving end-consumers where you need more leads and you need to convert these leads into sales, you'll need this.
[font]The only time when you may not need this is perhaps if you're selling with a business-to-business model. Where by, if you are selling tractors to companies at 7% margins, then of course chances are you want to rely on the Google Search engine instead, because your potential buyer is not looking on Facebook.
[font]However, if you are in a market that serves end consumers, then this thing is a must, not just to survive but to thrive in today's economy.
[b]Q: What's the best way to get a return on my investment?
[font]A: Now this is for those of you who are thinking , "$997 seems like a big investment." If you're at that level right now, then here's what I say.
[font]The best and fastest way to get your ROI back, that many of my students have done, is to implement this for somebody else, for another business owner, for another entrepreneur.
[font]This is highly specialized knowledge that many business owners need.
[font]They want to set up their Facebook campaigns, they want to target the right people, they want to run profitable ads, they want to be able to build a following. Most people don't know how to do it. So one of the fastest ways to get your ROI is to be able to take what you learn in here, and to apply it for just one client. And that's how you get your money back fast, not to mention that chances are they're going to be paying you a monthly retainer fee for that service as well. So that's the best way to get your ROI.
[b]Q: “Are there any upsells?"
[font]A: No, this is it.
[font]This is the complete mastery package where you get the best of running ads, building a following, infusing them together, having an entire system that works, so no, there are no up-sells.
[font]"Can I sign up next week?" Yes, big yes. In fact, I intend to make this evergreen, I intend to constantly update it and make it really great. You can totally sign up next week. The only difference is that, once we sell out of the initial 50, we're going to go back to $1,997 because this is part just the prelaunch.
[b]Q: "I can't afford $997 right now."
[font]A: Now, I don't know how else to say it, but that is pretty much an oxymoron. If you can't invest $997 right now in yourself, in your business to grow and to scale it, then chances are this is not for you.
[font]But at the same time, chances are it's also why you need this program more than ever. So if you can't afford $997 right now to invest in yourself and your business, my answer would be wait until you're ready, then come back to this page. But chances are we'll probably have gone back to our usual price of $1997 by then.
