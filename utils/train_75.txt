[p]If you want to start closing 60%-80% of sales appointments on the phone, via zoom, or face-to-face…
[p]…without burning through hundreds of leads...
[p]And you want to create
[strong]consistent income
[p]… without constantly getting rejected or stumped by objections you can’t handle…
[p]There’s only one way to do it.
[p]And it’s
[strong]NOT
[p]by reading books…
[p]Or taking dozens of courses…
[p]Or attending seminars…
[p]You see, closing sales is a lot more complicated than simply memorizing a few lines and repeating them to your prospects.
[p]To truly close at the highest level you must become a master of the tonality and psychology behind high ticket closing.
[p]The very skill I've mastered over the past two decades.
[p]And there’s no better (or faster) way I can transfer this skill to you than by getting you to listen to a collection of carefully selected role plays…
[p]Introducing:
[p]"The Art Of Closing High Ticket Sales"
[p]The exact role plays my team and clients are using to double our sales
[p]As you listen to these role plays over and over again, the art of closing High Ticket Sales™ will seep into your subconscious mind… and… just like a child learns to talk by hearing its parents… you’ll start to emulate what I do automatically.
[p]You’ll literally "force-feed" the art of closing high ticket sales into your brain.
[p]This is the ONLY method I use to train my in-house team of closers now...
[p]And it's working like crazy.
[p]In fact, since introducing this new way of training to my team… even new members of my team are closing at 60% to 80% of qualified calls.
[p]And my clients are instantly closing more sales without memorizing useless scripts or sitting through boring courses – hailing this as a “breakthrough” and the "only way to train their team from now on"…
[p]For example:
[p]And the only thing that changed is they replaced book-learning with role plays…. to master the art of closing High Ticket Sales™.
[strong]I can’t stress this enough:
[p]The ONLY way to gain the ability to close High Ticket Sales™ and enroll new clients faster and easier than ever before is to
[u]see (or listen to) the actual techniques in action.
[p]You must see and hear how the methods work in a variety of situations.
[strong]In other words:
[p]It takes a series of
[strong]role plays
[p]to show you how to do it….
[p]The exact role plays you’ll hear inside the secret recorded training sessions I conducted with my clients and my team that I’m now releasing for the first time to the public.
[p]The Counter-Intuitive Role Plays That Close High-Ticket Deals!:
[p]I’ve carefully selected the exact role plays that demonstrate and meticulously dissect the most important parts of any high ticket closing situation you'll find yourself in so you can master the skills you need and begin closing more sales this week.
[p]For example, right off the bat you’re getting:
[p]Role Plays to Help You Finally Overcome 15 Of The Toughest Objections You’ll Hear On A Call, Including:
[li]"Why should we pay you so much when other companies charge less?"
[li]Why should we choose to work with you?
[li]I’ve bought similar products from well-known people before, I committed 100% but it didn’t work, why will this program work for me?
[li]"Why should I buy your product or service when there are other options that might be better for me?"
[li]"Send me more information."
[li]"I need to look at my finances before making a decision."
[li]"What other companies have you worked with?"
[li]"What’s the guarantee?”
[li]"Can I get a refund if it doesn’t work?"
[li]"I don’t have time right now, call me in 6 months."
[li]"I’m speaking with 3 other companies before I make a decision, why should I choose you?"
[li]"Can you match the price of a similar program?"
[li]"I can get something similar from a different company, how is this different?"
[li]"This sounds interesting, can I pick your brains over coffee or lunch?"
[li]"You sound like a good person. But I don’t know your company well enough. How do I know I can trust you?"
[p]Plus I’ll Share A Way To Overcome Any Other Objection With A Single Question That Completely Disarms The Prospect, Making Them Doubt Their Own Objections
[p]You don’t need dozens – or even hundreds – of ways to overcome objections when you have one powerful way that works almost every time.
[p]And no, you don’t have to agree with the prospect or launch into a rebuttal.
[p]Just ask one simple question… with the exact tone of voice and pace of speech I share in the roleplays… and objections will melt like butter on the pavement in the hot sun.

[p]I’ll Equip You In Every Way Possible To Close Sales Like I Do – As Effectively As I Do It!
[p]As I said before, you can’t learn these secrets of closing High Ticket Sales™ from a book or by attending a seminar…
[p]You need to
[strong]see the methods in action
[p]and
[strong]listen to them over and over again until the lessons seep into your unconscious mind
[p]so you start doing it automatically.
[p]Plus I’m giving you…
[p]My Controversial "5 Questions To Close High Ticket Sales™ In 5 Minutes Or Less" Closing Technique…
[p]This is a method I developed that lets you close $10,000.00+ products or services in just 5 minutes with 5 questions.
[p]I know it sounds hard to believe.
[p]But I use this all the time when I have a highly qualified prospect on the line.
[p]You’re going to be amazed when you see it in action.
[p]It’s great for those times when your prospect is in a hurry or you don’t have time for a deep-discussion about the prospect's situation.
[p]These 5 questions get right to the point and help the prospect see that buying from you is in their best interest.
[p]But again, you can’t just ask the questions.
[p]You need the right tone of voice…
[p]The correct pace of speech…
[p]The right psychology…
[p]And that’s something I can only transfer to you by getting you to listen to the role plays.

[p]My Master Secret For Increasing Sales To Existing Clients...
[p]I’ve never shared this with anyone outside my internal sales team…
[p]It’s an outbound calling strategy I call the “DDS method” to get past clients and warm leads to buy more.
[p]If you or your team have ever experienced outbound call reluctance because you don’t know what to say to go from "how are you?" to "here’s something else you should buy"… this is the answer.
[p]Your warm leads and existing clients are your best source of new profits and High Ticket Sales™.
[p]But you can’t treat them like inbound callers or cold prospects.
[p]There’s a
[strong]specific way
[p]to communicate with them to turn new leads into clients and past clients into repeat sales quickly…
[p]That’s where the DSS method for closing outbound calls comes in.
