[h2]Composition 101
[p]Have ever looked at an image and said it seems to look off? Whereas you’ve seen other images that stop you in the tracks and make you say wow? I break down in great detail the different Rules Of Composition so you can see the fundamental building blocks of your images.
[div].et_pb_text
[div].et_pb_column
[div].et_pb_row
[h2]Should You Crop?
[p]How many times have you heard someone say “I’ll just crop it in post”? I hate that statement for many reasons. One, if you know you need to crop it, why not simply shoot it properly. Two, the more you crop, the more you hurt the quality of your images.

[h2]Camera Basics
[p]Cameras all function pretty much the same way. We take a walk around the mode dial so you get a full understanding of everything it has to offer. From the auto modes to A-S-M-P.
[div].et_pb_text
[div].et_pb_column
[div].et_pb_row
[h2]Shutter Speed
[p]Have you ever noticed that your subjects blurred across your image when they were moving fast? In the guide, I use a swing set to demonstrate what effect different shutter speeds have on freezing motion.

[div].et_pb_column
[h2]Does Shutter Speed Affect Exposure?
[p]It certainly does, the slower the shutter speed, the more light you let in. The faster the shutter speed, the less light you let in. Shutter speed also affects if you can freeze motion or blur it.
[div].et_pb_text
[div].et_pb_column
[div].et_pb_row
[span]ISO
[p]The general rule of thumb is, the brighter the situation, the lower the ISO. The darker the situation, the higher your starting ISO should be. In this section, I help you understand the best starting ISO based on what situation you’re shooting in. On top of that, I discuss what causes noise and grain in your images.tur.

[h2]Aperture
[p]Have you ever noticed that “blurry” “out of focus” background in images that make your subject pop? I’m going to teach you exactly how to make that happen even if you don’t have the most expensive gear in the world.
[div].et_pb_text
[div].et_pb_column
[div].et_pb_row
[span]Depth Of Field
[p]Do you want to get everything in the frame in focus or just the main subject? But what happens as I raise and lower my F-Stop? This section clears that all up for you.

[div].et_pb_text
[div].et_pb_column
[div].et_pb_row
[h2]What’s Variable Aperture?
[p]There are variable aperture and fixed aperture lenses in the world. Variable means the f stop changes as you zoom in and out. Fix means the aperture will stay the same no matter how much or little you zoom.

[div].et_pb_text
[div].et_pb_column
[div].et_pb_row
[h2]Focus Modes
[p]Do you know the right times to be using Single AF vs. Continuous AF? Do you know when you would want to switch into Manual focus and do all the work yourself? This section breaks it down perfectly.

[h2]What’s The Exposure Triangle?
[p]The exposure triangle is made up of three building blocks. These building blocks have stayed pretty much unchanged for the last 100 years. And more than likely, 100 years from now the building blocks will still be the same.
