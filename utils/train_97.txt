[u]peak performance
[h2],
[u]natural confidence
[h2], and
[u]lasting happiness
[h3]Hi, I'm Ramit Sethi,
[h3]author of the
[i]New York Times
[h3]Bestseller "I Will Teach You To Be Rich."
[strong]So why ARE some people 10x, 20x, even 100x more successful than us?
[p]Let’s be honest with ourselves
[p]It’s not just money or connections. (I came from a middle-class family of 6, and I had to pay my own way through college.)
[p]It’s not time. We all have the same 24 hours in a day.
[p]It’s not just intelligence. There are tons of smart people who aren’t successful…and tons of people with ordinary intelligence, who become ultra-successful!
[p]And it’s not just resources. We like to think, “Oh, HE went to X college,” but deep down, we know that while resources matter, there are plenty of self-made stories.
[h4]What makes someone 10x more successful than an ordinary person? More productive? And most importantly — HAPPIER?
[p]I knew I couldn’t “will” myself to be more successful. I tried random things, but they didn’t work — like going to the gym for 6 months and not seeing any results. I started second-guessing myself (“maybe I’m just a skinny dude and I’ll never get bigger”).
[p]The more I tried doing random things, the more frustrated I got.
[p]It wasn’t just about working out. I’d wake up with a full calendar of “to-dos”…and then, I’d get distracted by 50 random websites! I’d say things like, “I should really do that…” but in the back of my head, I knew I wouldn’t.
[i]As I said it, I KNEW I wouldn’t do it. Think about what that feels like — when you say something out loud, and you know you’re lying to yourself.
[p]I’d have hyper-spurts of productivity, but it happened sporadically. I couldn’t control my own productivity.
[p]And worst of all, I’d let critics get to me. When I decided to take an unconventional major in college, people said, “Ha, I guess that’s one way to avoid a real major.” When I took a communication class, people said, “Isn’t that class for athletes?” After hearing that a few times, I started doubting myself. And when your friends doubt you, and you start doubting yourself, where else are you supposed to go for support?
[p]Yet when I looked at top performers, they seemed supremely unaffected by these things. They’d wake up, kick off their morning ritual, start working, get twice as much done as most people, and finish on time — and just in time to hang out with friends and be totally relaxed. And they LOVED what they were doing…no matter what anyone else said!
[h6]How did they do it?
[p]I wanted to know. Actually, I got OBSESSED, since I knew that cracking the code would be worth more than any productivity system…any book on happiness….any “tool” or “tip” I could ever get.
[p]Mastering my inner psychology would mean knowing the road map to being successful, and confident, and happy. It would stick with me forever, to be used in virtually every situation — careers, social, personal, financial…even spiritual. Not just this week, or next month…but FOR LIFE. A Rich Life.
[p]So I began studying them: best-selling authors, CEOs, celebrities, top entertainers, championship athletes, world-class negotiators and more top-tier pros.
[p]You ever meet one of these people? They have TONS of responsibilities, but when you ask them, “How do you manage it all?” they just shrug. “Ah, you just take it day by day, I guess.”
[p]What the hell does that mean? I wanted to go deeper. If I could drink what they were drinking, feel how they felt, maybe I could understand some of the magic of top performers.
[h5]And what I discovered surprised me.
[p]I had a lot of assumptions about being “successful”…and at least half of them were TOTALLY WRONG.
[p]But I also realized that top performers follow patterns. Sometimes, they’re not even aware of the patterns themselves. But they follow them nonetheless. And from talking to top performer after top performer, I started to see these patterns.
[p]I want to share what I learned along the way, because I know if it surprised me, it will surprise you, too.
[strong]I’ll start with TWO BIG MYTHS that bowled me over.
[h6]MYTH #1: "I guess I'm not motivated enough"
[p]When was the last time you knew you wanted something, and you even started doing it…but then you never followed through?
[li]We wanted to go on vacation to Australia last year…but we never got around to researching flights.
[li]We wanted to start a business…but we never got around to finding an idea.
[li]We wanted to lose weight for summer…but after the first two weeks of going to the gym, we got busy.
[p]“I guess I’m not motivated enough,” we tell ourselves.
[p]It’s one of the most destructive 6-word sentences you could possibly say. By saying it, you’re giving yourself permission to fail for the rest of your life.
[p]You’re basically saying, “I’m the kind of person that can’t get things done. I’m lazy.” And once you label yourself that, how can you ever change?
[p]Worse, motivation has very little to do with success! Top performers don’t depend on motivation — which is fleeting and rare. They build systems, they hone their craft, and they systematically improve their mental psychology.
[p]So whenever you hear yourself saying, “I’m not motivated enough,” you’ve already lost.
[p]As I learned this, I thought back to all the times I failed at something. And almost without fail, I said the same words to myself: “I guess I’m not motivated enough.”
[p]So I dug deeper. How do top performers stop insulting themselves? How do they actually FOLLOW THROUGH on the things they really want?
[p]And that’s when I entered the world of productivity.
[h3]MYTH #2 Success is all about being more productive
[p]Isn’t it weird that we equate “success” with productivity? We literally use words like “I’m swamped” or “If I just had more time…”
[p]But close your eyes for a second. Imagine someone truly successful — someone world-class, at the top of their game, someone you admire. If you asked them, “What makes you successful?” how do you think they’d respond?
[p]Would they say: “It’s all about my productivity system!”
[p]NOT IN A MILLION YEARS.
[p]Yet WE chase productivity as if it — and it alone — will make us successful.
[p]Why?
[p]Because it’s “easy” and it’s in front of us. Think about it!
[p]We fall back on the “Two Ts” — Tactics and Time. We start to feel guilty about not being able to do everything. So what do we do? We begin the “Productivity Cycle of Doom”: We search for new tools and tactics, try a new one, watch it stick for a week…then we “yo-yo” back to where we were. And then we do it again!
[p]If we were brutally honest with ourselves, we’d admit that productivity is important…but you could be the most PRODUCTIVE person on earth…and that wouldn’t guarantee you’d be successful, wealthy, or happy.
[p]There’s got to be something else.
[p]And as I dug deeper into the dangers of chasing productivity, I realized that was just one part of a bigger problem.
[p]And I’d been guilty of it myself!
[h6]“Magic Bullet Syndrome”
[p]For years, I was guilty of looking at successful people and saying, “Well, THEY have X (big office, fast computer, XYZ education, a staff, a big blog). I don’t have those things, so how can I be successful?”
[p]I kept looking for a “Magic Bullet” — one thing that I THOUGHT would solve all my problems.
[p]Seeking out Magic Bullets is VERY common. People who aren’t satisfied with their lives are constantly looking for the one, easy shortcut that will solve all their problems.
[p]See if any of these examples ring a bell:
[li]The girl looking for a new job who believes that what she really needs is an amazing resume — as if getting the “perfect” resume will guarantee her the job of her dreams.
[li]The guy who wants to lose weight and keeps jumping from diet pill to diet pill — or workout routine to routine — as if a pill or routine alone will help him lose weight.
[li]The guy who spends HOURS every week working on his car because he thinks that is the key to attracting women.
[p]We ALL do this! If you dig in, you’ll notice what we’re actually doing:
[b]We’re going “external.”
[li]We’re convinced success is about getting a better resume…salary…recipe book…whatever. It’s always about something we don’t HAVE, as opposed to something we’re not DOING.
[b]We’re ignoring the brutal truth.
[li]We KNOW people who have the things we want…and they’re still not happy!
[p]I have a friend who — from the outside — seems highly successful. He’s well educated, makes tons of money, and has a lot of friends…but he isn’t happy. And for him, his Magic Bullet is always his CITY: “I’m kinda over this city…I’m going to move to [NEW CITY]…I think that’s what I need to do.”
[p]He never looks inside. He never once considers that it’s not his job, or his new cars, or the city he lives in.
[p]It’s not the situation. It’s not something “external.”
[p]It’s him.
[p]See, it’s so much easier to blame the things around us instead of truly looking inside to acknowledge what’s not working…and fix it.
[p]"There's a disconnect between what my head says and what I actually do. Otherwise I'd be rolling in it already…I always seem to get to a certain point and then start questioning whether it's a good idea or not. I'd consider myself pretty intelligent and a hell of a lot smarter than people I see being successful in business.
[b]So what part of it are they getting that I'm not? "
[p]- Josh P.
[p]And so we continue searching for our external Magic Bullets…and nothing changes.
[h6]THE WORST PART OF ALL!
[p]Here’s the most twisted part of this whole process.
[strong]We KNOW we’re doing it wrong…but we KEEP DOING IT!
[p]We know looking for productivity tools won’t change our lives…but we do it.
[p]We know that obsessing over optimizing our resume, or the latest Paleo diet, or the type of shirt to buy won’t make a big difference…but we do it.
[p]We know that saying, “I’m going to buckle down this month” NEVER works! Yet we keep doing it.
[p]I’ll talk to a friend who’s read all my material on starting a side business, and I’ll ask how it’s going. (This is a program that literally has copy-and-paste email scripts he can use to get new clients.) His response?
[p]"I know, I read all that stuff and I really want to start a business…but I just haven't done it yet.
[b]I guess I'm lazy."
[p]It’s easy to laugh, but we’ve ALL been in this situation.
[p]It’s NOT about more time.
[p]It’s NOT about having more tactics. (He literally had the word-for-word emails right in front of him…and he still hasn’t done it.)
[p]The worst part?
[p]He had all the things he “thought” he needed…and he STILL couldn’t do it! Ironically, now he feels worse. And what did he do? The worst thing of all: He labeled himself “lazy”…a label that will likely last a lifetime.
[p]Do you really want to call yourself lazy for the rest of your life?
[p]Do you really want to “say” you’re going to do something…but know, in the back of your head, that you’re actually never going to do it?
[p]What if you had the same “rulebook” that top performers did…so you could systematically change the way you think…for a lifetime?
[h6]THE TRUTH: Top performers think
[h6]very differently than others
[p]Top performers don’t lean back on the same “mental crutches” that most people use: They know productivity is important, but it’s just one small part of being successful and happy. And they don’t chase Magic Bullets.
[p]They know success isn’t just about tactics or more information. If it was, everyone would be fit, wealthy, and happy! After all, the information is out there — free!
[p](So why haven’t you done it already?)
[p]Instead, they focus on the most “under-utilized” muscle of all: Their MENTAL FRAMEWORKS.
[p]These mental frameworks are the “lenses” that they view the world through. Let me show you a simple example:
[p]Guy lets his mental barriers select him out of the chance of a lifetime… And he’ll never know why he misses opportunity after opportunity.
[p]Here’s an amazing opportunity (Andrew is a famous growth hacker offering to help other people for free). And what does the first commenter say? He SELECTS HIMSELF OUT by asking a pointless question.
[p]Why? Because he has a mental framework that says he’s not smart / talented / connected / productive / whatever enough to be successful, therefore why would Andrew want to work with him? That’s too painful to admit, so he goes fishing for an external reason to count himself out. (Note that his even ASKING the question disqualifies him.)
[p]A top performer would never do this. He would use a simple mental framework that says he’s worthy of success: “I’m a top performer. I’m good enough to get this. It doesn’t matter where I live — I’m good enough that he’ll select me.”
[p]Two different mental frameworks — two different “lenses” through which to see the world. Which do you think will lead to higher levels of success and happiness?
[p]I’m not talking about innate characteristics like “I’m short” or “I’m Indian.” Mental frameworks are LEARNED and MALLEABLE. You can improve your mental frameworks just like you can improve your social skills or health.
[p]And in fact, in the above example, if he simply USED the mental framework, he would have been perceived as a top performer. And over time, he would probably have become one! (In other words: Act as if.)
[p]Now, imagine if you had all the best mental frameworks in your “toolbox” — and dozens of “top performer” frameworks, all catalogued and ready for you to use at a moment’s notice.
[p]How would that change your interaction with the world?
[p]See, top performers realize that we work on improving our bodies (
[strong]gym
[p])…our finances (
[strong]automation
[p])…but VERY few of us systematically work on improving our behaviors (
[strong]mental frameworks
[p]).
[h4]Why is that?
[p]Especially when our “invisible scripts” guide our reactions to the MOST IMPORTANT things in our lives?
[p]Think about it! We see an opportunity — maybe it’s a scholarship, or a dream job — and what’s the first thing we say? “I could never get that…so I’m not even going to bother applying.”
[p]We see someone successful, someone we admire, and how do we react? “Well, HE had X advantage, and I don’t have that, so I could never do that…”
[p]THESE INVISIBLE SCRIPTS ARE KILLING US! They’re the invisible anchors around our neck, dragging us down as we try to swim towards freedom. And instead of figuring out how to cut that anchor loose, we search for tactic after tactic!
[p]What if we could rewrite those automatic scripts? What if we had a “toolbox” of new mental frameworks to reach for…so when we feel nervous, or frustrated, or even scared, we’d have access to the very same strategies and tactics that top performers use to overcome these feelings?
[h4]What I learned is that top performers have an entirely different way of looking at risk, success, and confidence.
[p]Take these common mistakes we’ve all made:
[li]Seeing a girl you like…and walking right past her instead of saying hi. (“I’ll wait for a while…let me have another drink first…ok, ok, I’m going to go up in 2 minutes…damn it, someone else is talking to her”)
[li]Passing by yet another job opportunity (“Why should I apply? I’m not qualified”)
[li]Letting critics make your life decisions for you (“I feel guilty…my parents helped me so much. Shouldn’t I at least try to make them happy?”)
[p]What I wanted to know was how top performers seemed to shrug these situations off effortlessly — and they kept getting more and more successful! The stuff that sidelined normal people seemed to “bounce” right off them.
[p]And I didn’t just want high-level, trite suggestions…I wanted the best stuff from the trenches. The nitty-gritty thought process that top performers go through in their toughest situations: Adversarial critics. Tough negotiations. Extreme challenges to their confidence.
[p]So I asked them, over and over. I probed. I pushed back on these top performers’ responses, going deeper and deeper. And I took their rules and tested them myself.
[p]Soon, I was putting together my OWN rulebook. And this set of mental frameworks has helped take me from a normal college student to a
[em]New York Times
[p]best-selling author with an audience of nearly 500,000 readers/month…and a multimillion dollar business. All while I’ve created the life I love to live:
[li]Going from being terrified of throwing events (since nobody used to come) to throwing a massive weekend-long event in NYC last year for 500 entrepreneurs
[li]Having a chef cook me healthy food that I eat 5 days/week
[li]Being able to buy my friends a round of drinks — and never worrying about the money
[li]Living in two apartments — one in New York, one in San Francisco
[li]From putting myself down as a “skinny Indian guy who can’t gain weight” to gaining 40lbs of intentional weight and benching 225lbs
[li]Appearing on TV including The Today Show, ABC, PBS, and even writing for the
[em]New York Times
[li]Having the freedom to travel wherever and whenever I want — including deciding on a Thursday that I want to fly across the country on Friday morning and see my old college friends
[h6]Here’s how I did it
[p]Let me break down how I accomplished this.
[p]First, I started dealing with critics.
[p]We all have them — people who constantly question our decisions. And they rarely come right out and say it directly.
[p]No, they’re craftier than that.
[p]They use words like “worried” — “Ramit, I’m just worried about you” — and express concern. “I’m just concerned, you know? Is this really what you want to do?”
[p]After a while, the doubt starts to gnaw and grind on you… and you start doubting yourself. I did!
[p]So instead of letting the doubt hold me back, after studying these top performers, I devised dozens of strategies to deal with critics. I tested them all. And I found the exact ways to respond to different critics — whether they were close friends, family members, or random people on the internet.
[p]Today, I get more critics than EVER, but they never affect me.
[p]Then I moved on to staying focused — especially eliminating distractions.
[p]Top performers know that productivity is one part of living a meaningful life… but instead of feeling guilty for YEARS for being unproductive, they build a system and move on with their lives. I was slowly adding more mental frameworks to my toolbox from what I learned and tested every day.
[p]And finally, I focused on becoming more confident.
[p]To tell you the truth, at different points in my life, I didn’t have a lot of reason to be confident!
[li]I was 5’11” and weighed 127lbs… why should I be confident about my looks?
[li]I started and wrote blog post after blog post — for THREE years — only to hear crickets.
[li]I would go into meetings and say something… but people would roll their eyes.
[li]I could talk to women like they were my sister, but I had no idea how to attract them as a man.
[li]I co-founded a startup and made every mistake in the book.
[li]I didn’t smile a lot, so I kept getting rejected from scholarship interviews.
[li]And sometimes I’d stick my foot in my mouth by saying the wrong thing.
[p]And honestly that’s just a short list of reasons why I wasn’t confident. There are so many more — like not being comfortable going to a movie alone, hating to eat by myself, not knowing how to dress right… etc.
[p]BAD RAMIT!
[p]But we all have these anchors around our necks when it comes to confidence, ambition, focus, excellence, honesty and more — anchors that hold us back.
[p]Yet over time, I learned how to systematically deconstruct each and every one of these.
[p]And now I want to help you do the same.
[h6]Why Success Triggers will always trump tactics
[p]After I identified hundreds of rules, guidelines, and mental frameworks, I tested each one exhaustively. I invented my own and tested them, too.
[p]Slowly, painstakingly, I culled the list down into a short list of essential mental frameworks.
[p]I call these
[b]“Success Triggers”
[p]because the concepts are so powerful, so striking, that once you hear them, they trigger a change in the entire way you approach challenges…for LIFE.
[p]For example, when my parents first said this phrase to me — “A year from now, you’re going to be a year older” — it stopped me cold. I realized, time is going to go by! I can choose to start doing cool things, and a year from now I’ll be in an awesome position…or I can do nothing, and a year from now I’ll look back and feel one intense emotion: regret.
[p]That mental framework will stay with me for life. And when times get tough…when I’m feeling lethargic or overwhelmed or confused…it’s my “signpost” for knowing the right thing to do.
[p]If I hadn’t heard that one Success Trigger, where would I be today? I can guarantee you I wouldn’t be as successful as I’ve been fortunate enough to become.
[em]And that’s just ONE Success Trigger.
[h6]I’d like to share 30 of them with you.
[p]See, we know that tactics are worthless without the underlying foundations of a strong mental game. For example, you know about some of my students who have the EXACT, word-for-word scripts to find a job or start a small business. Yet they can’t do it!
[p]Why? Because their mental frameworks are actually deadweight “anchors,” holding them back from success. They fear failure (“What if this doesn’t work? What will my family think? That I did yet another harebrained scheme again?”). They fear success (“What if this takes off and people discover that I’m not really good at this?”). They worry what others will think and let critics chart their course.
[p]Yet some people persist. They focus not just on external learning, like productivity and health.
[b]Top performers also systematically improve their mental frameworks.
[p]They know that ultimately, as you become more successful, tactics are a commodity — everyone knows them! What separates the truly successful, wealthy, and happy people is having mental strength.
[p]The fortitude to persist when times get tough.
[p]The knowledge to know you can do something…and the ability to summon self-confidence, even when you don’t feel confident inside.
[p]And the conviction to say YES when it matters — and NO when something isn’t right for you.
[p]Over time, these mental frameworks become “burned” into invisible scripts. They become your instinctual responses, giving you an instant playbook for success.
[p]It’s like Biff’s almanac in
[em]Back to the Future II
[p]— they’re a cheat sheet to the future.
[p]I’m here to give you that cheat sheet.

[h6]HEAR FROM OTHER STUDENTS WHO’VE UNCOVERED THEIR SUCCESS TRIGGERS
[p]“My main barriers to getting things done were time and the ‘invisible script’ that I was lazy. The course really helped me realize that
[strong]I could change my mindset
[p]and that not getting things done was not a question of laziness.
[strong]I work full time, I recently had my first child, I’m married and own a home, and all of these things take time
[p], work and brain power. I don’t need to waste more brain power and energy feeling bad about the things I’m not getting done.
[strong]Once I changed my mindset, I didn’t have to worry about it anymore.
[p]”
[h2]— Rachel Bowman
[p]“I’m starting to build systems that are helping me to develop a network of mentors and fellow tax professionals. I’m also testing systems that are helping me to become more organized and a better time manager. I by no means have a perfect system yet. However,
[strong]I’ve already been able to double my production at work and I’ve really started to be able to systematically overcome my weaknesses and fears.

[h2]— David Boudreax
[h6]Just one final reminder
[p]We spend most of our lives going through our toughest challenges alone.
[p]We struggle to learn how to attract the opposite sex.
[p]We feel guilty about our weight and diet.
[p]We resign ourselves to our own poor social skills, never understanding that they are “skills” that can be systematically improved.
[p]And we settle for our jobs, our finances, even our lifestyle!
[p]Worst of all, we rarely share our struggles…since we’re “supposed” to know how to do these things on our own (right?).
[p]What I’ve learned is we don’t have to struggle through these challenges. In fact, if we JUST got help on the biggest 4-5 sticking points in our lives, we could soar by leaps and bounds.
[p]When I studied the top performers that helped me create my Success Triggers — so that I could live the lifestyle I want, without ever worrying about money or travel or vacation time — I learned two of the most important lessons that’ll stick with me forever.
[strong]Top performers focus on relationships and leverage them to grow faster and deeper than everyone else.
[li]This doesn’t mean they’re scammy or slimy. It means they ask other people for advice, and they actually follow through! As a result, when I started asking for advice, and investing in self-development material, it made perfect sense: I didn’t need to reinvent the wheel — others had already paved the path for me.
[em]It was up to me to decide to take the right road.
[strong]These top performers use Success Triggers to create disproportionate results and to systematically improve their mental game.
[li]They realize that they invest in improving their body, at the gym, and their finances, via books and automation…but they realize their most powerful asset of all is their mental strength.
[p]Most people go a lifetime chasing random tactics, becoming frustrated, and even giving up. Think about it — that’s DECADES of frustration.
[p]How many people do we know who are 40, 50, even 60 years old, who have destructive mental patterns? How many people do you know who let opportunity after opportunity sail by…even though they claim they want a better life?
[p]Now, fast forward your own life: What if you did nothing differently today…and ended up like them tomorrow?
[p]Top performers recognize the importance of mastering tactics, but they know that their mental strength is the one key that can never be commoditized or taken away. Your Success Triggers provide the ultimate leverage in finding success, wealth, and happiness.
[p]You don’t have to do this alone. I went through the painstaking process of discovering, testing, and producing these Success Triggers. They’ve helped me live a Rich Life, and I’d like to share the same with you.
[p]These aren’t one-time techniques you’ll use this week or next month. These are techniques for life. So it’s natural that you have lifetime access to this course — since I expect you’ll use these now, 5 years from now, even 15 years from now.
[p]I created
[em]Success Triggers
[p]as your “secret playbook” to improve your confidence, conquer fear, manage critics, and master your inner demons. Let’s take this journey together.
[h2]A year from now, you're going to be a year older. What are you going to do?
