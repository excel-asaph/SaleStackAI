[h2]Watch me write
[span]3 sales emails
[h1]worth $379,643
[h2]right infront of your eyes
[h2]For the first time ever, get a behind-the-scenes look at this
[strong]Power Trio
[h2]of proven sales emails we use in every product launch.
[em]I used a “Big Reveal” email in our Success Triggers launch and made $82,358 from that one email.
[h2]Or in our How to Talk to Anybody launch, where
[strong]our "Free Taste" email made $28,721
[h2]— even though we'd already launched this course many times.
[h2]And our
[strong]"Last Chance"
[h2]email in a Zero to Launch funnel pulled in
[strong]$165,803 in just a few hours.
[h2]I even used this
[strong]Power Trio
[h2]of sales emails in our automated evergreen funnel … where they've helped drive
[strong]over $5,000,000 in revenue.
[div]Over the past 10 years, I’ve used these emails to sell everything from a $0.99 Kindle e-book to a $10,000+ advanced course.
[span]Get Instant Access
[h2]I've used these emails across multiple categories, including:
[p]Business
[p]Careers
[p]Social Skills
[p]Productivity
[p]Psychology
[p]Freelancing
[p]Cooking
[p]Events
[strong]The Power Trio emails can be used in any niche, from business and
[strong]productivity to events and beyond.
[h2]These
[strong]powerhouse emails
[h2]allow us to consistently sell products while engaging our readers — and do it all
[strong]authentically
[h2]— without resorting to scammy or spammy sales tricks.
[p]And once you see and understand the inner-workings of each of The Power Trio emails, they are
[em]fast
[p]and
[em]easy
[p]to write.
[h2]Best of all, you can now watch along as I write this Power Trio of sales emails for a launch — and
[strong]earn $379,643 in just a few days.
[h3]Today, I want to show you exactly how I did it.
[h2]Hi, I'm Ramit Sethi, the New York Times
[strong]Best-selling Author
[h2]of
[strong]I Will Teach You To Be Rich
[h2]and the founder of IWT and GrowthLab.
[h2]We launched a new program called
[strong]Mental Mastery.
[h2]That launch pulled in
[strong]$617,944 in about a week.
[p]And it did it off of a funnel without a hard sell, without a webinar, without affiliates, without Facebook ads or any other gimmicks. Just a few casual emails and a sales page.
[h2]Three of those emails
[strong]— The Power Trio —
[h2]brought in over 60% of all our revenue.
[p]Here’s the funnel:
[h2]Here's the
[strong]amazing part,
[h2]: We use this Power Trio of proven sales emails in every launch we run.
[p]These three emails are the heart and foundation of our sales. And every time we sit down to write sales emails, most of the funnel and sales push is mapped out before we even start.
[p]The truth is, when it comes to sales, you don’t have to start from scratch. There’s no need to do it all yourself. You can lean on what works. Make it your own and add your voice, but don’t make your life unnecessarily difficult.
[h2]If you don't have our Power Trio of
[strong]proven, authentic sales emails,
[h2]you're just causing yourself agony.
[p]If you were an architect, would you relearn how to draw every time? No, you’d have a few fundamentals and models in your back pocket.
[p]If you were a musician, would you invent a new scale for each song? No, you’d know a few chords and basic music theory and focus on the fun part — making music.
[p]The same is true of sales emails and growing your business. You don’t need to start from scratch. You can save yourself all that time, hassle, stress, and failure.
[h2]Why wouldn't you start with The Power Trio of authentic sales emails that are proven?
[h3]"It shouldn't be
[strong]this hard"
[h3]I made
[strong]2 big mistakes
[h3]when I first tried to sell online.
[strong]The first problem
[p]was when I sold a $4.95 e-book. My sales copy was so cowardly, so timid, that I actually told people all the reasons they might NOT want to buy. I think I did a better job convincing people to skip it than to buy.
[p]While it was thrilling to see those first few sales, it was also painful to watch readers unsubscribe — and call me a “sellout.”
[strong]The second mistake
[p]was also bad but in a different way. Years later, I was selling a $497 program on freelancing. This time, I’d gotten more confident about selling. But instead of simply telling people what the product was and why it might be a good fit for them — NOPE! That would be too easy! — I decided to write about all the features … all of them … and go on and on and on and on…
[h2]IN TOTAL: I wrote
[strong]5 weeks of sales emails
[h2]. Over
[strong]25 emails
[h2]AND
[strong]15 long, detailed blog posts.
[h2]I'm starting to sweat just thinking about doing that again.
[h2]The
[strong]GOOD NEWS
[h2]is, we sold a lot — over
[strong]$600,000 in sales.
[p]But my team and I were completely wiped out. Exhausted, bleary-eyed, and drained. It took me 6 entire months to get back to full speed.
[p]The first time, I’d sold too softly. Then, next time I’d overcorrected in the opposite direction, writing hundreds of pages and burning myself out (and many of my readers, who unsubscribed).
[p]I was genuinely trying to help my readers, but I started to wonder if I would ever find a happy balance where I could sell effectively, unapologetically, and keep it simple.

[h3]The words that kept whispering in the back of my head:
[strong]"It shouldn't be this hard."
[strong]My approach to sales copy, in a nutshell, was this:
[p]When I sold a $4.95 e-book, my sales copy was so cowardly, so timid, that I actually told people all the reasons they might NOT want to buy. I think I did a better job convincing people to skip it than to buy.
[p]While it was thrilling to see those first few sales, it was also painful to watch readers unsubscribe — and call me a “sellout.”
[p]How much coffee can someone drink while writing sales copy before they die
[blockquote]— Ramit Sethi (@ramit)
[a]May 15, 2015
[strong]Ugh,
[h2]even looking at that tweet reminds me of sitting down and knowing
[strong]next 6 hours were going to be painful.
[h2]Then  to sleep unhappy, waking up, and
[strong]doing it all over again …
[h2]for days (or even weeks) at a time.
[p]But that was all I knew, that writing sales emails was hard, frustrating work.
[p]And worst of all, the results felt random. Sometimes all that effort worked and people bought. Sometimes it didn’t, and I’d be left sitting in my apartment, wondering why so few people were interested in the email I had spent hours painstakingly crafting.
[h3]"I didn't read the copy.
[strong]I just clicked the buy button"
[h2]Thankfully,
[strong]writing sales emails
[h2]is the
[strong]polar opposite today.
[p]Now when I have some sales emails to write, I sit down and open up a document where most of the blanks are already filled in. I have an
[strong]outline
[p], I know the
[strong]key emotional points
[p], and I
[strong]don’t have to fret over features and bullet points.
[h2]What's left is the
[strong]FUN
[h2]part.
[p]The creativity, the flourishes, the jokes about hot sauce, actually helping my readers — the things that I love doing and am good at.
[strong]I don’t have to worry about how to sell,
[p]if I’m selling too much, or if my emails will sell at all. I know they will.
[h2]Instead of starting from scratch each time, I have proven and popular emails I can model — like
[strong]The Power Trio
[h2].
[div]I can focus on the few, critical parts of any sales email (more on this later) and use a handful of reliable strategies to make writing them fast and simple.
[strong]I can even break up my time
[div]. (This one surprised me. Even when I’m writing a monster sales funnel, with guidelines like The Power Trio, I can write a little, take a break, then improve it later. It’s not a problem to step away for days or weeks at a time. This is hugely freeing!)
[div]Best of all, I can focus on
[strong]authentically
[div]helping my readers and be confident that the sales will roll in.
[h2]Case in point:
[strong]Our Mental Mastery launch pulled in $617,944 in a week.
[h2]Most of that
[strong]revenue came from just three emails
[h2]— emails that were fast and fun to write and read, and that my followers loved.
[strong]To my readers, the emails looked like:
[li]An interesting discussion about what makes some people so
[strong]successful
[li]A hilarious story about Judge Judy and a free sample of my
[strong]new course
[li]A
[strong]quick courtesy
[li]reminder so they didn’t miss out
[p]Nothing inauthentic. Nothing spammy.
[strong]No sleazy sales tricks.
[p]But the emails
[strong]were carefully crafted to be enjoyable
[p]AND
[strong]authentic
[p]AND
[strong]still sell.
[p]These emails worked so well that some people didn’t even read our sales page!
[p]Or this student:
[h2]One reader was so excited by our sales emails that he couldn't believe
[strong]Mental Mastery was only $297
[h2]and
[strong]not $1,000.
[p]Best of all, when I wrote these emails, I actually finished early and stepped out early for lunch with friends in the middle of a weekday.
[strong]You can do this, too.
[p]You can write emails that your readers
[strong]LOVE
[p]— and grow your business. You can do it without doubt and frustration and stress. You can do it without years of practice. Best of all, you can write the kind of emails that your audience looks forward to reading and sharing with friends.

[strong]Q & A
[h4]There are lots of books about sales. What's different about Behind the Sales Email?
[p]I’m a big fan of lots of books and courses on copywriting. But after studying hundreds of books and courses — and writing millions of dollars worth of sales emails — I wanted to show you
[u]the actual process of writing an authentic sales email.
[p]There are many things you’ll learn in
[em]Behind the Sales Email
[p]that no book could ever teach you:
[li]Watch exactly how I write copy, including where I spend my time. It’s the difference between reading a recipe book and watching a chef cook it on video. You see what it should really look like when it’s done right.
[li]What’s the difference between selling authentically and being spammy? How do you know when to start selling … and when to stop? How do you blend sales and stories? You can never learn this from a book. But you’ll see it in this course, which will save you hours on your next batch of sales emails.
[li]We also include lots of subtle techniques — writing techniques, structural secrets we’ve learned, and psychological insights we’ve pioneered — all in
[em]Behind the Sales Email
[li].
[h4]What's the difference between Behind the Sales Email and other GrowthLab products?
[p]In short,
[em]Behind the Sales Email
[p]is surgically focused on how to write
[u]authentic
[p]sales emails.
[p]We offer several courses that help you improve different aspects of your copy.
[em]Behind the Sales Page
[p]is a focused, behind-the-scenes look at how we write sales pages.
[em]Call to Action
[p]is a comprehensive copywriting course that teaches you everything from customer research, copywriting mindsets, writing blog posts, emails, opt-in offers, and more.
[p]All of these courses are designed to complement each other and can be taken in any order.
[h4]What if I don't sell products? Does this course work for service businesses? Or memberships?
[p]Yes! The sales emails we profile in this course are for an information product like a video course or book, but the principles in
[em]Behind the Sales Email
[p]can be applied to products, services, memberships, SaaS — any copy where you’re trying to sell.
[h4]What if I'm not a writer? What if I've never sold anything before?
[p]You don’t need to be an amazing copywriter to write authentic sales emails. The magic is in the process. If you can write an email or a blog post, you can sell.
[h4]How do I know if I need this course?
[p]Have you run into any of the following challenges when writing sales emails:
[li]Where do I start?
[li]How do I get the reader to really want my product?
[li]How can I make my offer without sounding salesy?
[li]What goes in each email?
[li]How do I transition to selling without sounding awkward?
[li]How do I know if what I’ve written is actually good?
[li]How can my sales email be effective while still being
[em]honest
[li]and
[em]authentic?
[p]If so,
[em]Behind the Sales Email
[p]will help you.
[h4]What if I can't tell if my emails are good or not? Will this help?
[p]Yes! A key piece of
[em]Behind the Sales Email
[p]is an insider’s look at how I evaluate sales emails … including the steps I take to improve any emails that aren’t yet ready to publish. This is one of the reasons why WATCHING me create these sales emails is so powerful.
[h4]How long does this course take?
[p]You have access to the entire course as soon as you enroll, but you can go at your own pace. To go through the course material and complete all of the exercises, expect to spend roughly 3-4 hours total.
[h2]This is what
[strong]Authentic Sales
[h2]looks like
[p]Way back in 2015, I launched a popular course called Success Triggers. In that funnel, I used many of the strategies you’ll learn in Behind the Sales Email. It was a 6-figure launch, and my inbox was flooded with positive emails from our readers.
[p]My favorite response, however, didn’t come until three years later…
[p]This student not only purchased the product, he loved the sales email so much that he saved it for inspiration … AND remembered it years later!
[p](And this wasn’t an unusual sales email. It was our straightforward “
[strong]Last Chance
[p]” sales email, part of
[strong]The Power Trio of emails
[p]you’ll learn in
[strong]Behind the Sales Email
[p].)
[h2]The fact is,
[strong]your sales emails
[h2]will
[strong]make or break your business.
[p]If you don’t know how to write a great sales email, you’ll sell too hard and turn off your readers. Or you’ll not sell hard enough and your business will stagnate, wither, and slowly dry up.
[p]But if you do
[strong]learn
[p]how to write a
[strong]great, authentic sales email,
[p]you’ll be able to
[strong]delight your audience
[p]AND
[strong]grow your
[strong]business at the same time.
[p]Having even
[strong]one
[p]reliable sales email in your back pocket can save your next launch.
[p]Having
[strong]two
[p]reliable sales emails is enough to build an entire business upon.
[h2]Having our whole
[strong]Power Trio of authentic sales emails
[h2]can change your
[strong]business
[h2]— and
[strong]life.
[p]You don’t need to use sleazy sales tricks or be a natural salesperson. Anyone can write authentic, money-making emails once you understand the behind-the-scenes work that goes into one.
