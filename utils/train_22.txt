[strong]The Spirit  of
[strong]Masturbation....e-book  course.
[strong]SAD EXPERIENCE  OF   EXCESSIVE     MASTURBATION....
[p]“I did this horrifying act for 20 YEARS and have just as of recently found out all the destructive results it has upon your mind, psychological health and your body. For ANY so-called ‘doctor’ or ‘expert’ to dare teach and explain that this sin, this great wrong is actually good for you- may the Lord God deal mercifully and justly with that person or persons.
[p]Not only does this vile act cause and lower sperm count….look at what it does to the person: depression, guilt, schizophrenia, dullness of intellect and comprehension, feelings of worthlessness, highly unbalanced nerves and mood….these are just a FEW of the long destructive results.
[p]Many, including myself, had been told repeatedly time and time and time again how unhealthy this act is. For one, it is a great and offensive sin against God and your own body. Porn is also destructive, as it ruins relationships and the possibility of maintaining a truly happy and healthy one. Stop looking at how it makes you feel in the act. Consider- CONSIDER!!- WHAT THE LONG, POSSIBLY LASTING EFFECTS IT HAS ON YOUR MIND AND ATTITUDE AND INTELLECT.
[p]Like many, I ignored the warnings because I didn't see and fully comprehend the destructive results it had on my mind! Now, I have a bad focus and anxiety problem. I can’t focus or perceive things in the way that God created my brain to be able to. I need help”

[p]"When I finally agreed and accepted it was a SIN, I tried many mechanic ways to stop, all failed, it grew worse.
[p]I got fed up with this act, I had to run to JESUS, and with the help of an unveiling a masturbation book course. I was sincere, I was desperate for Him to help me, and I prayed, confessed my sins and asked for washing and cleansing by His Blood.
[p]Now. I’m FREE. The bondage of 2 Years was broken. Now it’s almost 4 months now, and I’ve been free, and Yes"....
[p]. sister Ann. a student.
[em]"I have long believed in biblical principles of spiritual living as children of God. Ever since I became born again I began my journey in search of the spiritual path that one can find to overcome all the struggles and the strategies of the devil. And one of them is the issue of masturbation which is also one of the ways that the devil is really capturing the sons of men and putting them in a cage of spiritual blindness. I used to think sex is only a thing of physical pleasure and one only needs to do it the right way, but with my experience as a born-again child of God, I came to understand that it is deeper than what it looks like on the outside. So this book is a timely book in this dispensation that we are in. I believe the spiritual insights that are hidden in this book will bring liberty to you and set you free from the bondage of demonic programmed sex in the dimension of masturbation. I pray God will open you up to the spiritual insights that are treasured in this book and set you free in Jesus' mighty name Amen"
