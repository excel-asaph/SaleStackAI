[span]“Everything Great In My Life Was Created Inside Of The RIGHT
[u]Rooms
[span], With The
[u]RIGHT People
[span]...”
[b]“History is not shaped by great men, but by demanding environments”
[span]- Will Durant
[b]From: Russell Brunson
[b]Boise, Idaho
[span]In every area of my life, success didn't come to me UNTIL I was able to get into
[b]the RIGHT rooms, with the RIGHT people.
[span]​
[span]​It started in middle school for me. I started to wrestle, but didn't have much success.
[span]​
[span]​My Dad called the High School coaches, and got me into their wrestling room, years before I was old enough to actually be there.
[span]​
[span]​Being in a room that expanded my vision, my mindset and my skill set.
[b]By my junior year, I had won a state title, and my senior year, I took 2nd place in the nation and became an All-American!
[span]The environment that I put myself in, made it possible.
[span]When I decided to take my wrestling career to the next level and to compete in college, I moved into a new room, that had people who had already achieved what I wanted to accomplish.
[u]It was the secret to my success...
[span]“I Struggled In Business, Until I Got Into The Room That
[u]Dan Kennedy
[span]Had Built...”
[span]During college, I decided to start a business online.
[span]​
[span]​I had years of trial and errors...
[b]with a few small success in between
[span].
[span]I KNEW that if I wanted to get to the next level, I would need to find an environment with people in it that could help me to grow.
[span]That is when I joined Bill Glazer and Dan Kennedy's mastermind.
[span]Over the next 6 years I flew to Baltimore, MD, three times per year, to be in this room.
[span]Over those years,
[b]my business grew from 6 figures a year...
[b]To 7....
[b]...And then eventually 8!
[b]This room was the secret to my success.
[span]“Before I Started
[u]ClickFunnels
[span], I Knew That I Needed To Build A Room With My Co-Founders...”
[span]It started as just an idea...
[span]​
[b]​I was in a room with Todd Dickerson and Dylan Jones on a white board...
[span]After the idea started to grow, we started to great our own "Avengers" team of people to help us to grow.
[span]Without taking on any outside money, just building rooms of smart people and environments where we could grow...
[u]We built one of the fastest growing startups in the world!
[span]In just a few short years we grew from nothing, to over a billion dollars in sales!
[b]These rooms was the secret to our success...
[span]“As We Started To Scale, I Searched For Rooms I Could Place Myself In, That Would Challenge My Thinking Everyday...”
[span]Years later, when I reached my next plateau in life, I was invited to join a very special room with
[b]Tony Robbins
[span]in Fiji.
[b]It was in this room where I had one of my BIGGEST breakthroughs regarding my own pursuits when it comes to me being fulfilled in life and business…
[u]…and it changed EVERYTHING for me!!!
[span]Notice a pattern??
[span]​I can say, without a shred of doubt, in order to get where you want to go… to achieve your wildest dreams… there comes a point where you need to break out of your “silo” and surround yourself with folks who are achieving their goals with unwavering ​determination.
[b]​​In Other Words:
[u]You Need To Be “In The Room.”
[b]As the saying goes, you are who you surround yourself with…
[span]…and who you surround yourself with is determined on choosing the right “room” to learn and grow!
[b]The room is where you have COMPLETE focus,
[span]surrounded by other like-minded individuals who are there to help take you to the next step in your journey.
[span]The problem…??
[span]It became
[u]harder and harder
[span]for me to find the next “room” to continue my growth…
[u]So I Created It.
[span]I created THE ROOM where it all happens, where entrepreneurs, such as yourself, can lift each other up and learn exactly what to do to “bust through” sales stagnation… giving them the knowledge and tools to go from 6 to 7 and 8 figures and beyond!
[span]​And that room became what is now known as my Inner Circle!

[b]where you can adjust so you can unlock your business’ full potential.
[span]As you may know,
[i]“small hinges swing big doors,”
[span]and when it comes to ‘Decade In A Day’, many of my Inner Circle members say
[b]the yearly fee is worth it for this benefit alone.
[span]Again, it all happens “in the room” where you get the chance to not only meet with me,
[b]but also network with other high-level, elite entrepreneurs

[span].
[span]Event #4: Inner Circle “Classic” Event

[span]During this event, you are in a smaller group of 18-20 business owners, and we spend 2 days going deep into each person's business, and pulling out the gold!
[span]This is the way Bill Glazer ran his events back in the GKIC days that got me to break out of the 7-figure “ceiling” and into the 8-figures /yr status.
[span]No one in the marketing industry is doing it the way I do it.
[b]This is the certified Russell Brunson way of running an event
[span]where you walk away with real, actionable strategies and advice you can apply directly to your business for
[u]results you can see FAST!
