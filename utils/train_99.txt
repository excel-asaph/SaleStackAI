[h4]-- To the 6-figure business owner: --
[h1]How to DOUBLE the size of your business
[h2]Let me guess: To grow, you’ve tried
[u]webinars
[h2],
[u]paid ads,
[h2]and
[u]automated launches.
[h2]We tried those, too. We even tried
[u]conversion
[u]optimization,
[u]subscription programs,
[u]quizzes,
[h2]and dozens of other strategies. (No kidding. I’ll show you below.)
[h2]Some of those strategies worked. Some were total duds.
[span]But two of them generated more revenue than everything else —
[i]combined.
[h2](I'll show you those, too.)
[h2]Look, lots of CEOs can generate 6 figures. But only a few make the decision to grow to
[b]$1 million and beyond.
[h2]If you’re serious about growth,
[span]read on
[h2].
[b]Hi, I’m Ramit Sethi, the
[i]New York Times
[b]best-selling author of
[i]I Will Teach You To Be Rich
[b]and the founder of IWT and GrowthLab.
[h3]When I got serious about growing my business,I tried a ton of stuff.
[p]I did everything I could think of. Maybe you’ve tried some of these, too…
[p]I wasn’t kidding when I said everything.
[p]And we went deep.
[p]Here are just a few screenshots showing you just how deep we went on some of these things.
[p]We didn’t mess around.
[b]So, which of these do you think significantly moved my business forward?
[p]The answer is none.
[p]I’ll tell you the two things that
[em]did
[p]drive growth in a bit. That’s what this whole page is about.
[span]But first, I need to tell you a scary story.
[p]It’s about a business owner running a $300,000/year business. On the surface, everything looks great:
[span]She's making more money than she ever dreamed of. In fact, she made more in her last launch than she did in a year back when she had a "normal job"
[span]She just took a 4-week trip to Italy, which gave her plenty of amazing Instagram pics to post
[span]Her customers are happy. They love her product and every week she gets new, unsolicited success stories from her followers
[p]Life is good.
[p]Unless you take a closer look…
[span]Yes, she does make more in one launch than most people make in a year. But her last launch was 60% the size of her previous one … which was only 70% as profitable as the one before.
[b]She has no idea why each launch keeps shrinking
[span]She spent most of her trip to Italy working from her Airbnb. She wanted to unplug, but with so many projects in motion,
[b]if she stops, the business stops
[span]And worst of all,
[b]many of the old tactics that built her business aren't working like they used to.
[span]She's working harder for smaller rewards. Wasn't success supposed to be easier?
[b]Welcome to the 6-Figure Plateau.
[p]I’ve never talked about the 6-Figure Plateau publicly because, frankly, very few people have experienced it. They wouldn’t understand.
[p]Millions of people dream about working for themselves, but very, very few are actually able to accomplish what you have.
[p]If you’re reading this, that means:
[span]You've found a profitable business idea
[span]Built up an audience of fans
[span]And earned 6 figures (at a minimum)
[span]Created a product people want
[p]As you can imagine, the market for this level of material is very, very small. Which is why it’s so hard for you to find information at this level that you can trust.
[p]I’ve been in your shoes. I know that the very hustle and tactics that got me from $0 to 6 figures a year weren’t the same ones that got my business to a healthy $1,000,000+ per year.
[p]It’s just not possible to “hustle” that much. There just aren’t enough hours in the day. You’d burn out first. My guess? You’re starting to feel the strain already. I know I was.
[span]Wasn't work supposed to get
[u]easier
[span]when you started hiring?
[span]Wasn't success supposed to be more
[u]fun
[span]than this?
[span]Why are you more
[b]stressed
[span]now than when you started?
[span]If you’re willing to put the work in — and you clearly are, if you’re reading this page — what’s the
[b]right roadmap
[span]to follow?
[p]The 6-Figure Plateau is a major challenge for every successful business. The bad news: Most 6-figure entrepreneurs never break out of the plateau. Their businesses stay stagnant, they try the same things over and over — and over time, the founder’s enthusiasm fizzles, then fades out.
[p]To me, that’s a special kind of hell: knowing that you were good enough to get “here” but not “there.”
[p]But there is good news. You can grow past the plateau — but it means changing the way you think about your business. As Marshall Goldsmith says, “What got you here won’t get you there.”
[p]I’ll show you how I learned this in my business.
[h2]The "aha moment" that rewrote my whole playbook
[p]When I was just starting IWT, I just focused on writing great material. I didn’t even think about traffic, email list, etc. I heard about people with 50,000 subscribers on their email list, which I thought was an unimaginable number.
[p]Eventually, I saw other people adding “opt-in forms” to their website. I didn’t know how to do that, so I begged a friend to help me set it up. I basically stumbled into it.
[p]But once I saw the numbers, I realized this was a huge deal.
[p]Like when I launched a $497 product and made $600,000. Whoa, this was serious.
[p]Or when I asked myself, “What if I raise the price to $997?” So I tried it. The conversion rate went down a little, but I basically doubled my revenue.
[p](By the way, a healthy chunk of that revenue came from adding on higher-end tiers, raising the AOV. And that product is still selling well for me today. Imagine getting all those numbers dialed into your business for a single launch. Then replicating it over and over.)
[p]Then I thought, what if I get more subscribers? BOOM. That’s when business really started to explode.
[p]Over time my team and I got extremely serious about growth. We saw the power of driving more leads, we built a team around it, studied it, experimented.
[p]I’m proud to say that we hit our goals, then we
[u]exceeded
[p]them. We doubled the size of our list — four times over.
[p]What do you think happened to revenue? Did it also grow the same amount?
[p]Nope.
[p]Revenue grew, but not at near the same rate as our leads. In fact, we were working harder than ever but our results were plateauing.
[b]What was going on?
[p]And what would it mean for you if you did the same thing?
[li]You decided to grow in a certain way
[li]You put “everything you got” into it — your time, your money, you even hired people to help you
[span]You achieved your goal
[span]…But then you realized, it didn’t actually move the needle
[b]This is when a lot of founders give up.
[p]They tried “everything” — and it still didn’t work. It’s hard not to feel a little hopeless. They don’t want to give up on the project (especially after spending so much money), so they continue to kick it around, keeping it on life support. Then they add on tiny little other projects, like…
[span]A/B testing, when they only have a trickle of leads…
[span]Partnerships that they hope will really make a difference (somehow)…
[span]Crazy automation schemes so that once they get everything off their plate, finally, they can focus on "strategy"…
[p]And those little projects make them feel productive, but deep down, they know it won’t move the needle in a big way. And they end up meandering along, slowly crawling, getting a hit every once in a while … but mostly just existing. Again, this is hell to me.
[p]Back to our story…
[b]Why did our leads grow so much, but our revenue lagged behind?
[p]Why did it get
[i]harder
[p]to grow the bigger we got? After some digging, we found that many of our new leads were much, much lower quality than expected. These were paid leads, and they cost me over $2M and thousands of hours of work.
[p]OK, so paid leads are lower quality than organic leads. That makes sense. But even understanding that the paid leads were lower quality didn’t fully explain why our revenue was plateauing while our list size was growing.
[p]Then we discovered this:
[p]After 30 days, conversion rates for new leads dropped by two thirds.
[p]After 60 days, they dropped by another half.
[p]In all our tests, we found that a lead is vastly more likely to buy within the first 30 days.
[p]This is really counterintuitive: We thought the longer they’re on the list, the more they like us, right?
[p]Wrong.
[h3]Surprise #1: As lead age goes up, engagement almost always
[h3]goes DOWN
[p]This is called
[b]lead decay
[p]and it has some staggering implications:
[span]What matters is NOT how big your email list is. It's NOT how tight your opt-in flow is. It's NOT how intricate your automated email funnels are.
[span]What matters is how many NEW leads you can pull in each and every month.
[p](For your business, run this analysis: Compare the average lead age of your new customers from the past year. You’ll discover that new leads are vastly more likely to buy — which means it’s
[u]critical
[p]that you find ongoing sources of new leads to grow your business. Otherwise, your existing list will slowly deteriorate and you won’t even know it.)
[p]The biggest implication with lead decay:
[strong]your future is bigger than your past
[p].
[p]Most founders agree with that intellectually. But here’s what it actually means for your business.
[p]The list you have today — the 10,000 or 50,000 people or whatever it is that got you this far — those readers are NOT the same ones that are going to take your business to $500,000, $1,000,000, and beyond.
[p]The future of your business isn’t on your list today. It’s out there, in the real world. It’s people who haven’t even heard of you yet. That means you need to focus on building a serious system for acquiring new subscribers today to grow your business
[u]tomorrow
[p].
[p]This wasn’t the only wrinkle we discovered…
[h3]Surprise #2: Products decay, too
[p]In our digging, we discovered that lead decay wasn’t the only silent business killer out there. Like gravity,
[b]product decay
[p]is quietly pulling your business down.
[p]Just as leads become less valuable over time, products dry up, too.
[p]If your strategy doesn’t address product decay, the foundation of your business will erode right under you.
[p]This is why successful, ambitious, talented business owners get stuck in the 6-Figure Plateau!
[p]It’s why so many promising businesses hit a wall and never reach their full potential. Lead decay and product decay eat away at your successes until you start sliding backwards.
[b]By the way, have you noticed that nobody ever talks about this?
[p]It’s one of those uncomfortable truths about business. It’s so much easier to talk about 1,000 true fans and cool new split-tests.
[p]I was guilty of this for years. I used to think, “Man, I already have a list of 50,000 people. I can just ‘1,000 True Fans’ it and sell to them forever!” I really liked that idea. I thought I had it made.
[p]Nope.
[b]OK, so what do you do about it?
[p]How do you fight lead decay and product decay and break out of the 6-Figure Plateau?
[h3]Enter the Double Engine Strategy
[p]When I was hellbent on testing every growth tactic I could think of, I had a lot of resources at my disposal.
[p]I had developers, designers, project managers, support staff, copywriters, product developers, SEO experts, affiliate managers, assistants, video producers, audio engineers, and more — all ready to jump on any wild idea I could come up with.
[p]I was a kid in a candy shop — except instead of buying a Twix bar, I wanted automated text message reminders.
[p]My point is, I had the resources and the ambition to grow. I pushed both as hard as I could. As a founder, what if you could do this?
[p]If I were sitting in your chair, my first reaction would be EXCITEMENT!
[p]But my second reaction would be CURIOSITY. “Wait a sec … you already did this stuff. So did it work?”
[p]I’m glad you asked.
[p]Some of these tactics made us some money,
[b]but the vast majority didn’t move the needle on our business at all.
[p]They LOOKED like they were important. Most of them even FELT like real wins. But none of them drove
[u]real
[p],
[b]sustainable
[p],
[b]ongoing growth
[p]. (Look at the work you’re doing in your business today. Is it driving real, sustainable, and ongoing growth? You need all three.)
[p]In the end, we found there were two — only two — things in an online business capable of driving real growth:
[p]That’s it!
[span]Your Product Engine
[h3]+
[span]Your Lead Engine
[h3]=
[span]Growth
[p]First, your
[b]Product Engine
[p]. That is the machine that drives all revenue in your business. It’s not your funnels or sales pages. It’s your products.
[p]What if we took all the energy we were spending on gimmicks and marketing tactics … and simply spent that time improving our products? When we did that, we found massive results.
[p]And the flipside: if you don’t have a proven
[u]strategy
[p]in place to consistently create the RIGHT products for the RIGHT customers at the RIGHT price points, your business will slowly deteriorate.
[p]Take a candid look at your products. How fresh are they? How often do you release a hit? When was the last time you took customer feedback and fixed the problem areas?
[p]Then there’s getting new people to discover you. That’s your
[b]Lead Engine
[p].
[p]Your Lead Engine is the machine that drives all leads to your business. Your buyers today fuel your business tomorrow — that part makes sense — but the great surprise here is that to keep growing, you won’t be able to depend on your existing customers. The idea of customer loyalty, that “it’s easier to keep a customer than to find new ones,” is a huge myth. You need new customers — period.
[p]That means you take all the energy you spend on marketing gimmicks, on generating “one-time pops,” and redirect it to building a serious system that grows your leads
[b]every single day
[p].
[p]That’s why it’s called a Lead
[u]Engine
[p]— it’s your strategy for attracting new, high-quality traffic and leads, over and over, day in and day out.
[p]We spent millions of dollars and years of hard work on events, webinars, paid ads, the works. That list above doesn’t even include everything we tried.
[p]But only two things actually drove meaningful growth, year after year: products and leads.
[p]We call this
[span]The Double Engine Strategy.
[p]If you get these right, your business will grow. If you get them wrong — or you miss them altogether — your business will slowly stagnate. You might already be feeling it now as you try marketing tactic after marketing tactic.
[h3]How it felt to discover this
[p]It’s hard to convey just how extremely liberating it is to find this Double Engine Strategy. We knew that if we just focused on these two things, we could grow the business and we could ignore everything else!
[p]This meant we could stop wasting time on the things that don’t move the needle, and start doubling down on the things that do. No more coming up with random ideas that would increase revenue 5% or 10%. We were either building our Product Engine or our Lead Engine.
[p]Imagine getting together in a room with someone you trust. They look at your business and list out every single initiative you’re doing on a whiteboard. Then, together, you draw a huge RED LINE through the ones that don’t matter — leaving you with only a few key strategies that move the needle.
[p]You can take all the time, money, and energy you used to spend on those random tactics … and focus them on the ones that do matter.
[p]How would that feel?
[h3]What's holding you back
[h3]from high growth?
[p]Many biz owners say they want to grow … but never do it.
[p]After we conquer the minefield of Invisible Scripts and tactical challenges of starting a new business … finally make it to 6 figures … it’s understandable that we think we have it all figured out. We’re already winners, right?
[p]Just gotta keep on keeping on!
[p]But one thing that the Double Engine Strategy has made crystal clear for me is that you can’t keep growing by doing the same things you’re doing now.
[p]You can’t break out of the 6-Figure Plateau with 6-figure strategies. You need to play a new game, and you need to rewrite your 6-figure Invisible Scripts.
[p]Most business owners get stuck in the 6-Figure Plateau because of one or more of these Invisible Scripts. (I struggled with growth for years before I overcame mine.)
[h3]Invisible Script #1:
[h3]"I don't need more information.
[h3]I just need to focus on taking action"
[p]At a certain point, you don’t need to read another book or attend another event. You know what you need to do — you just need to execute it.
[p]Or so I thought.
[p]I put my head down, stopped attending events, and started to execute. I didn’t need more advice, I needed to drive the shit out of my business and grow it.
[p]Well, the good news is I succeeded. I posted more, I got more traffic, I got more subscribers, and I got more customers.
[p]But I also caused a lot of unexpected problems. My technology became insanely complicated (so it took us hours to send a single email … and we send 10+ emails/week).
[p]I couldn’t track what was working and what wasn’t, so after a while, I was doing more of everything.
[u]It felt like pushing on a 500 lb piece of Jello
[p]. You have no idea if you’re moving the thing at all — and no way to judge it.
[span]I actually hate Legos, but I know how this guy feels.
[p]I decided to step back and get some outside advice. To my horror, a lot of the stuff we were doing wasn’t working. Worse, it was actually hurting us. For example, think of a grocery store trying to sell something that people just don’t want. Not only is it failing to sell, but even worse, it’s costing them money since they can’t use that shelf space to sell something else.
[p]That’s a double-whammy, the kind you only realize if you zoom out and get a bird’s-eye view of your business.
[p]In my business, things got so unwieldy that my only option was to just do more. More webinars, more ads, more emails, more blog posts. And at 6 figures in revenue, you start to wonder how you can ever do enough to get to $1 million.
[b]How do other people do it?
[p]Do they just work harder than I do? I thought I started a business so I could scale, not just overwork myself again.
[p]Worst of all, I wasn’t even sure where to focus. If I did more blog posts, what would that get me? If I created a new product, was that the right thing to spend my time on? What about email? Or social? Or paid? Or my team?
[p]Your business is like a plane, if it’s one degree off it crash-lands in the ocean. You need to be absolutely sure you’re heading in the right direction — as well as course correcting all the time — not just “taking action” on your current trajectory.
[p]“I acted as if to-do’s were either ‘important’ or ‘less important,’ but time spent on either category was valid and fine. Now, I realize that the CEO’s time is the rudder of the ship, and I should ruthlessly prioritize things that will ACTUALLY AND SIGNIFICANTLY move the needle.”
[p]— Erik Kennedy, Learn UI Design
[h3]Invisible Script #2:
[h3]"Growing my business means changing it into something I won't enjoy as much"
[p]When I started my business, I was adamant about a lot of things.
[span]“I don’t want a big team. I just want to keep it small and intimate”
[span]“I would never create a product about that”
[span]“Doing X, Y, and Z is the right way to grow”
[p]Boy oh boy, was I naive.
[p]In a lot of ways, I don’t even know why I said those things. Why did I want a small team? I told myself I wanted to keep it small because I liked the idea of a powerful tiny team changing the world…
[p]…but in reality, I was scared of growing a team. That’s because I had no idea how to manage people, how to implement an HR strategy, even how to set up weekly 1-1 meetings!
[p]So I let this single statement — “I don’t want a big team, I just want to keep it small & intimate” — guide
[i]literally years
[p]of my business. I never questioned it. It was just a given.
[p]The problem is, I started to run into constraints. I couldn’t do everything I needed to do. I started losing customers because I couldn’t give them what they wanted. I needed help. But still, I resisted hiring. It wasn’t the money — I had that. It was this deep-seated Invisible Script, buried so deeply in my psyche, that I didn’t even know it was there.
[p]And, like any serious problem, it’s never easy to find. My Invisible Script manifested in weird ways, like me having the perfect candidate and then, inexplicably, I invented a reason not to hire them because “now’s not the right time.”
[i]YOU’RE LOSING CUSTOMERS BECAUSE YOU CAN’T GIVE THEM WHAT THEY WANT! HERE’S SOMEONE WHO CAN HELP YOU DO IT!
[p]Yet the voice in my head said “No.”
[p]In retrospect, I was wrong. It’s good to listen to the voice in your head, but you must also realize that that voice wants to keep you safe and comfortable — not to push you hard. Yes, hiring was hard. Yes, management is hard.
[p]But I’ve now reconceptualized a team from a huge downer (“Oh no, I’ll have to manage them, payroll will go way up, and I have to handle all these calls every day…”) to something positive: “We get to build something big together. I could never do this alone!”
[span]I The power of a talented team is one belief I had to rewrite in order to grow..
[p]You might need to hire people. You might not. Hiring people isn’t the point.
[p]What I’m telling you is that
[b]we each live by assumptions about our business
[p]that we genuinely believe right now. As CEO, your job is to ruthlessly search out which of those assumptions are not true.
[p]For some, that’s scary.
[p]I find it
[i]liberating
[p].
[p]It means that the shackles of my business — the ones I had put on myself! — can finally be removed. When I flipped the conversation from “I can’t do that because…” to “What if I could do that…?” I could grow the business in ways I never thought possible before.
[p]“I thought my business had to look a certain way in order for it to be successful. Now I realize I have total freedom to define what success looks like while having a fun, profitable business.”
[p]— Brett McQueen, Ukulele Tricks
[h3]Invisible Script #3:
[h3]"Growing my business means changing it into something I won't enjoy as much"
[p]Ah, Special Snowflake Syndrome. This one gets me really riled up because I was guilty of it for so long — and I see the negative consequences it caused me.
[p]Here’s how it typically goes:
[b]“I can’t make that work for my business because we’re different”
[b]“I’m too advanced for that course — I need a coach to work with my exact situation”
[span](of course, any good coach costs $25,000 - $50,000, with no guarantee, and most people are not prepared to pay that … so there goes that option)
[b]“I already know that”
[span](if you already know that, why aren’t you earning more?)
[span]And of course,
[b]“My business can’t grow due to ___
[span]” (insert your industry, price point, customers, etc … and completely ignore all the others who have grown much larger than you)
[p]You’ll notice some odd ways that Special Snowflake Syndrome affects CEOs of growing businesses.
[p]I remember one student saying, “We already hit all our keywords on Google. We rank for everything. What else can we do besides SEO?” My team and I smiled. This CEO was doing a few hundred thousand dollars in revenue. There are companies that do
[i]billions
[i]of dollars
[p]using SEO as a primary channel. This CEO thought he was on top — and in his tiny industry, he was — but he was really a tiny fish in a big pond. We encouraged him to target more competitive keywords and play in a bigger pool.
[p]By my estimation, he should be able to grow to $5 million within 3-5 years.
[p]Yes, your business IS special — and you can keep it that way — but the fundamentals of business don’t change.
[p]As CEO, you must fight Special Snowflake Syndrome tooth and nail. You must deeply understand the forces that shape every business — and the levers at your disposal to drive real growth.
[p]Otherwise your actual strategy is “hope and pray.”
[p]“I thought I should ‘be more careful’ and more cautious. I was very present to the fact that most businesses fail well before the 10-year mark, and I was concerned about getting it wrong.”
[p]— Sarah Jones, Introverted Alpha
[b]How many of these scripts do you have?
[p]What’s your gut-level response to them?
[p]The solution is not to ignore them. Or to “work harder.”
[p]You can’t hustle your way to $1M. But you can unlock high-growth with the right strategy.
[p]The Double Engine Strategy shows you that you’re not a Special Snowflake. You’re not all alone. And you don’t have to change your business into something you don’t want. But by focusing on the right things — your Product Engine and Lead Engine — you can accomplish so much more with less effort, headaches, and stress.
[h2]Kick your business into high-growth —
[h2]even while you sleep
[p]Are you ready to double the size of your business — while working less?
[p]Are you ready to stop spending most of your time on low-value tasks and projects that might actually be damaging your business?
[p]When you learn how to implement the Double Engine Strategy, the first thing you feel is RELIEF.
[p]I showed a small group of students a partial, sneak peek of the Double Engine Strategy. Here’s what they had to say…
[p]“It helped me completely overhaul my business to make it 20% more profitable and in 15+ hours less a week.”
[p]— Scott Barlow, Happen to Your Career
[p]“I went from considering whether I should shut it all down after 4 years of work to consistently making a profit, paying myself a good salary and cutting back to working on it part time.”
[p]— Jacqui Pretty, Grammar Factory
[p]“The changes I’ve made to my business have put us on pace to more than double revenue this year while working less.”
[p]— Shirag Shemmassian, Shemmassian Academic Consulting
[p]And that was after just a quick look.
[p]How would it feel to be able to grow your business while cutting back on your hours?
[p]After I implemented the Double Engine Strategy, I used the extra time I saved to explore NYC, go to shows, spend time with friends, and travel abroad.
[p]I’m also able to treat myself to more spur-of-the-moment fun, like finding the best burger in NYC:
[span]I Before-and-after burger pics. Ugh, maybe this one was a mistake.
[p]But, more than lifestyle perks, you know what I like?
[b]I just like to WIN.
[p]That’s what the Double Engine Strategy does best.
[p]I love joining some friends for a book club meetup and getting an email telling me my business just made another $10,451. Just another Sunday.
[p]I love to sell out events.
[p]But more than that, I love waking up every morning to unsolicited thank you emails and impressive testimonials. I love seeing my students and my team live their Rich Lives. I love making a real impact on thousands and thousands of people every day.

[h3]Go behind the scenes of a 6-figure business —bonus deep dive
[i]Double Engine Growth
[p]gives you unprecedented access into the strategy, tactics, numbers, and day-to-day operations of IWT and GrowthLab. You’ll see how I, as CEO, am driving growth and solving problems every day (without ignoring my personal life or missing out on fun along the way).
[i]Double Engine Growth
[p]is also packed with dozens of examples and scenarios from real 6-figure businesses. This real world material is baked right into the course.
[p]And on top of all that, we also included an hour-long deep dive into a growing 6-figure information product business. I sat down with a CEO for a candid look at the challenges, opportunities, and insights from her business.
[p]Behind-the-scenes examinations of real businesses — like this deep dive — are incredibly rare. This is included with
[i]Double Engine Growth
[p].
[h3]Ask Me Anything:
[h3]Two "closed door" Master Calls
[p]Plus, if you join
[i]Double Engine Growth
[p]this week, you’ll receive two “closed door” Master Calls that I hosted — only for
[i]Double Engine Growth
[p]students.
[p]I rolled up my sleeves for two, fast-paced, advanced, live Q&A sessions. These featured real challenges that real 6-figure business owners are facing today. No nonsense and no beginner material.
[p]Both of these recordings are only available for
[i]Double Engine Growth
[p]students.
[h3]Q & A
[span]Will this work?
[span]What exactly is the Double Engine Strategy?
[p]The Double Engine Strategy is the driving strategy behind the rapid and lasting success of IWT and GrowthLab. It details exactly what to focus on — and what to ignore — to unlock high-growth in your business.
[p]We have spent years of effort and millions of dollars testing dozens and dozens of growth strategies. We know what’s hype, what’s not worth the effort, what’s a dead end — and most important, we know what works.
[span]The Double Engine Strategy works.
[p]And this is the only place you can learn how to apply it to your business.
[b]How do I know if I need this course? Who is this for?
[p]This course is for information product business owners who earn at least $100,000/year in revenue and want to grow. It’s also for successful coaches who want to shift their businesses to a primarily product-based model.
[b]I’m already busy. I don’t want
[i]more
[b]work…
[i]Double Engine Growth
[span]is built specifically for busy CEOs. The program is advanced and condensed. You get instant access to the entire program and all the bonus material as soon as you join.
[p]You can jump right to the sections that excite you the most and save the rest for later. Plus, with video, audio, and transcripts included, you can review the material however you prefer.
[b]What if I don’t sell products? Does this course work for service businesses? Or memberships?
[span]This course is primarily designed for information product business owners. Most of the examples we feature are information product businesses. However, we do discuss some 6-figure service and membership businesses.
[p]The advanced service or membership business CEO will still get a lot of value out of this program.
[b]What if I teach underwater basket weaving? What if I wear glasses? What if I’m allergic to pants?
[span]Watch out for Special Snowflake Syndrome. Being a successful CEO isn’t about getting perfectly tailored advice; it’s about tailoring the advice you do get to your business.
[b]What if I’m not sure I even want to make $1M a year?
[span]If you want to build a “passive income” business and retire to a beach in Thailand, great. If you want to lean in and drive significant growth, great. No matter what type or size of business you want to build, you need to understand the principles of growth, or your income — and livelihood — will decay.
[p]Personally, I’m unapologetically bullish on growth.
[i]Double Engine Growth
[p]is for 6-figure business owners who want to hit $1M and make a larger impact with their business. Now, you don’t have to work overtime or burn out to do it. You can actually double the size of your business while working less. I’ll show you how, but you have to want it if you’re going to succeed.
[span]About the program
[b]What’s the difference between
[i]Double Engine Growth
[b]and other GrowthLab products?
[span]This is the most advanced and most strategic GrowthLab product ever.
[i]Earnable
[span]shows you how to start and build your online business.
[i]Double Engine Growth
[span]shows you how to take that successful business to 7 figures and beyond.
[p]You don’t need to own any other GrowthLab products to join
[i]Double Engine Growth
[p], but you should already have a 6-figure online business.
[b]How long does this course take?
[span]There is no time limit. Once you join, you get access to all of the material and can go through it however you like. Jump right to the topics and questions that are most pressing for you and save the rest for later. Reviewing the entire course, start to finish, including all modules, bonuses, and activities, would take about two days.
[b]How much help will I get? Should I take a mastermind instead?
[span]Masterminds are hit-and-miss — some are good for networking but very few provide clear strategic guidance. Coaching can help with accountability but doesn’t provide clear strategic guidance either. That’s why we built this program as a course.
[i]Double Engine Growth
[span]is about giving you the strategy that will drive your growth for the next decade; it’s not about keeping you company when you feel like chatting with someone.
[p]That said,
[i]Double Engine Growth
[p]is packed with questions from other 6-figure business owners — and Ramit’s no-nonsense answers. And we’ve included two Master Calls with Ramit — just for
[i]Double Engine Growth
[p]students.
[b]Do I need anything to implement the Double Engine Strategy? Any special software or technical skills?
[span]No. This course is about CEO-level strategy, not fancy tools or technical tricks. You’ll be able to apply what you learn right into your business.
[b]Do I need a team to use the Double Engine Strategy?
[span]No, the Double Engine Strategy can drive growth in a solopreneur business just as well as a company with dozens of employees like IWT.
[p]But if you want to build your team to grow faster or make a larger impact,
[i]Double Engine Growth
[p]includes an entire module and set of bonus materials to show you how.
[h3]Yes, you have other options to grow your business
[span]I’ve already told you that
[i]Double Engine Growth
[span]will give you the street-tested strategy behind the rapid and lasting success of IWT and GrowthLab. This program also includes the nuts and bolts behind how to implement the strategy. It’s everything you need to drive your business to $1M and beyond.
[p]How else could you figure out how to catapult your business into high, sustained growth?
[b]Attend mastermind groups?
[span]This will cost you anywhere from $20,000 – $100,000 per year for 2-3 annual meetups with sophisticated marketers. A few are good, most are run by “gurus” who haven’t achieved high growth, but masterminds are focused on networking — not strategy.
[b]Hire a high-priced consultant?
[span]You could look for a “CEO whisperer” promising you growth for 5-digit fees (and possibly a cut of your revenues). But finding a reputable consultant is even harder than finding a mastermind that actually moves the needle.
[b]Do it yourself?
[span]That’s how I did it. Slowly, for years, with the help of dozens of top-notch employees and millions of dollars of investment. I’m not exaggerating here.
[p]You could take this path, too, but to be perfectly frank, I don’t know why you would. If you join
[i]Double Engine Growth
[p], you could shave 10 years off your learning curve and save hundreds of thousands of dollars (or millions) in failed tests and dead ends.
[b]Do nothing?
[span]This is the default path for most CEOs stuck in the 6-Figure Plateau. You’re earning enough money right now. Sure, your results may be slowing down, but you’re not panicking yet. You don’t know what to do, but you decide to “figure it out” tomorrow instead of today.
[p]This is the most haunting choice of them all. You could double the size of your business while working less if you simply decide to act. Why wouldn’t you?
[p]By the way, if you’re at all concerned that
[i]Double Engine Growth
[p]might not work for you, I want to make it clear you’re covered by…
[h3]An UNBEATABLE guarantee:
[span]Try Double Engine Growth for a full 60 days,100% risk-free
[p]We’ve packed a lot into
[i]Double Engine Growth
[p], and I want to make sure that you not only get all that content before you fully commit to this — I want to give you 60 days to let it digest, integrate it into your life, and make sure this is really working for you.
[p]Try the entire course. If you don’t LOVE it, I insist that you get 100% of your money back. I’ll even eat the credit card processing fees.

[h3]That's not all — join today and get a hand-picked selection of the IWT Growth Letters
[p]Every week, our former Sr. Director of Growth, Lars Lofgren, wrote a letter to the entire IWT and GrowthLab team. Each letter is a full transparency, no-punches-pulled investigation of a critical question, challenge, project, or opportunity we were working on.
[p]Lars included data from IWT and GrowthLab, insights from his deep expertise growing online businesses, and takeaways from our Leadership Team meetings.
[p]It’s like sitting in on real executive-level meetings at IWT — see what we’re seeing, hear the questions we’re asking, and get the inside scoop on the conclusions we’re coming to. You can watch as we build our strategy, take action, and track the results.
[p]When you join

[p]“I started delegating tasks I thought were my ‘personal burden,’ doubled down on lead acquisition channels that mattered and shut every project that didn’t fit the decided path. We’re growing faster both in leads and in revenue while I have more time to think, strategize and… go to the spa. 🙂 “
[p]— Géraldine Lepère, Comme une Française
[p]“I’m enjoying my business again.”
[p]— Brett McQueen, Ukulele Tricks
[p]“What I’ve learned from Ramit is way more than what I spent over 100K to learn in business school. Thank you Ramit for changing my life and helping me make a bigger impact in the world.”
