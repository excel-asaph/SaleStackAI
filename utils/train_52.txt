[b]The Super Simple
[b]Lead Funnel
[div]That Changed My Life...
[b]From the desk of Russell Brunson:
[div]Dear Entrepreneur,
[div]I’m really excited, because I want to show you a simple 2-page funnel that recently generated us over 185,372 new leads.
[div]The reason I want to show it to you is because I want you to MODEL it so you can apply it to YOUR business.
[div]But before I show it to you, let me take you back to the famous funnel that was the inspiration for my 2 page funnel… And
[u]changed my business forever.
[div]About 13 years ago, there was no such thing as a lead funnel or landing page or a squeeze page.
[b]Back then, leads were generated using ‘pop up’ ads.
[div]I don’t know if you remember, but Pop-Ups were these mini-pages that would suddenly appear out of nowhere on your page when you were browsing.
[div]Sometimes 3, 7, even 14 of these suckers would burst onto your page.
[div]They got so overwhelming that people complained in droves.
[div]And just like that, popups vanished...
[b]And then something happened.
[div]This one particular webpage I was hearing about was capturing tons of leads.
[div]I mean EVERYBODY was talking about it.
[div]So I had to check it out.
[div]What I saw was totally underwhelming.
[div]I thought to myself...
[b]“I don’t get it... There’s hardly anything on the page. It’s a headline and 6 bullets and an email optin.
[b]What the heck?”
[div]I started to think I was on the wrong page, but when I asked my internet buddies about it, they told me that...
[b]...this page was raking in
[b]$20 Million
[b]a YEAR!
[b]WHAAAA?
[div]How is that possible? I don’t understand.
[div]I couldn’t take the suspense. I HAD to know what on earth was behind the next page after the optin.
[b]But there was problem.
[div]See, I had just gotten married.
[div]And the webpage was a dating site called
[b]“Double Your Dating.”
[div]It was by a guy named David D’Angelo (aka Eben Pagan)
[div]The lead magnet on this page was called
[u]“The Kiss Test,”
[div]and
[b]when you gave your email, you would know—with this test—if a girl on a first date would want to kiss you or not.
[b]What guy wouldn’t want
[i]THAT?
[div]Well, being newly married, I was scared to death to tell my wife about this.
[div]I started stressing about opting in. I wanted to know for MARKETING purposes how this landing page pulled in $20 Million a year…
[i]But if I told my wife, she’d be like,
[b]“Why do you need to know about kissing another woman on a first date?”
[div]I stressed about this for a week until I finally got up the nerve and fessed up about what I wanted to do.
[i]Without batting an eye she said,
[b]“You stressed over this? Really? Go do it.”
[b]Nice. I just wasted a whole week frying my brain for nothing.
[div]So I opted in and I got the
[u]Kiss Test.
[div]What I saw floored me.
[b]It was just a
[b]short paragraph!
[b]Check this out:
[b]Is that all I get?
[b]That’s the Kiss Test guys are scrambling
[b]to get their hands on?
[div]I STILL didn’t get how this thing was making $20 Million a year (or even $200!)
[div]This newfangled ‘squeeze page’ and the ‘lead magnet’ page were plain and simple and forgettable.
[b]And then I saw there was an offer to buy a dating ebook.
[div]I decided to check out what was going on. So I bought the book.
[div]That took me to the next page, where there was an offer for a course (more expensive). So I bought that.
[b]And then I hit a page that sold coaching for even more money.
[b]AHA! This is SO COOL!
[b]I get it.
[div]I studied the Kiss Test ‘funnel’ and ‘value ladder’ and all the copy for 2 solid weeks.
[div]I put everything under a microscope so I could fully understand what was happening and WHY it worked.
[b]It took a bit for it to sink in, but it finally hit me that
[b]The Kiss Test funnel was
[u]packed with…
[b]Curiosity
[b]Desire
[b]Persuasion
[b]FOMO (Fear of Missing Out)
[b]Open Loops
[b]Specificity
[b]Simplicity
[b]So what I did was, I
[u]modeled
[b]The Kiss Test
[b]lead funnel for MY business.
[div]I used it for my speed reading course, supplements, affiliate offers, and a few other things I was selling at the time…
[b]And it worked like crazy…
[b]for all my products!
[div]All I did was model the same Kiss Test headline and swap out a few words and modeled the bullets.
[b]BOOM!!
[div]Leads came flooding in.
[div]The ‘lead funnel’ I swiped was in the dating and ‘pickup’ niche, yet it worked like magic for me in totally different niches!
[div]It was like I struck gold.
[b]It Gets Better...
[div]So get this…
[div]Last year, I modeled the Kiss Test lead funnel again. Now remember, this landing page is over 13 years old.
[div]But guess what?
[b]It STILL worked!
[div]I built a lead funnel for a lead magnet called,
[i]“The Marketing Secrets Black Book.”
[b]The RESULT?...
[b]Over
[u]185,372
[b]NEW LEADS!
[div]Here’s the point of all this…
[div]You can take any one of the 106 lead funnels, landing pages, thank you pages, and bumps inside
[b]The Lead Funnel Swipe File
[b]and model them for
[u]your
[b]business…
