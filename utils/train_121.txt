[p]"Channel Jumpstart completely transformed how I approach YouTube. Before joining, I was stuck in trial and error, but Derral gave me the clarity and strategy I needed to grow. Since implementing the methods, I’ve seen real results—I started at 60k subs and now have over 7 million subs . If you’re serious about YouTube growth, I highly recommend Channel Jumpstart!"

[p]“I’ve been doing YouTube full time for 8 years and was still able to learn new things through CJS. I believe that what I learned about storytelling and retention techniques is just what I needed to bring my channel to the next level. CJS has really opened my eyes to why other creator’s videos go viral which helps me adjust my own strategy.”

[strong]WHAT IS CHANNEL JUMPSTART
[div]]
[div]
[
[div]Hey, it's Derral Eves.
[span]I’ve been on YouTube since it began in 2005, and I have learned basically everything there is to know about YouTube! I have worked with many of the world’s top creators and have seen the patterns of what works and what doesn’t on YouTube.
[div]]
[div]
[
[p]Helping creators kill it on YouTube is my passion, and I want to help you, too.
[p]So I distilled my years of experience into a simple system called “Channel JumpStart” that produces consistent results for my "JumpStarter" students.

[

[
[div]Do you think you're already making great videos, but YouTube just hasn't picked them up yet?  YOU'RE NOT ALONE.
[p]That is why I created the Channel JumpStart system -
[span]to help creators just like you.
[div]]
[div]

[
[strong]THINK ABOUT SUSTAINABILITY
[div]]
[div]
[
[p]How long can you "go all out"
[span]for? Can you upload daily for a year? Ten years?
[span]Channel JumpStart is about creating a sustainable system rather than views for just one video.
[span]Ultimately, running a YouTube channel is a business, and you are everything from the CEO to the Accountant, Videographer, and Janitor. You must have systems in place to ensure the channel will continue to perform optimally throughout the lifetime of the channel.
[span]Channel JumpStart is the sustainable system you need.

[p]“There's nothing worse than finding success, but not knowing how you got there. That’s exactly where I was before Channel JumpStart. Early in my YouTube career, my videos performed well, but I had no clue why. Over time, my channel started to decline, and I felt completely lost. That’s when Derral stepped in. He helped me pinpoint my audience, understand what kept them watching, and break down my content to see what was truly working. More importantly, he showed me how to replicate that success. Since then, my channel has gone from struggling to growing every single day. Now, I have a clear vision of where I want to take it, and the strategy to make it happen!”

[p]"Before Channel JumpStart, we were throwing spaghetti at the wall, trying to pivot our content but getting nowhere. We had 25,000 subscribers and no real strategy. Then we joined CJS, and everything changed. We learned how to craft engaging YouTube Shorts that didn’t just get views but actually grew our long-form audience. We started to build an audience we connected with and everything took off. Channel JumpStart gave us the blueprint to turn Shorts into real momentum, and that shift transformed our channel."

[p]"Channel Jumpstart has completely transformed my YouTube growth. I’m getting more consistent viewership than ever before, and my older videos are picking up serious momentum. And for the first time EVER, my long-form content is making  more money than shorts! The strategies I’ve learned here are game-changing."

[p]To say Channel Jumpstart is worth it would be an understatement! It has had a huge impact on my family, YouTube channels, and business! I was one of the first “jump starters” and I wouldn’t be where I am today if I hadn’t implemented what I’ve learned from Derral and Juston. I am so grateful to have found Channel Jumpstart 6 years ago. Looking back I can say it was one of the best decisions I made for my Channels!

[p]Channel JumpStart completely changed the game for me. With Derral's guidance, I monetized my second YouTube channel in just 7 days—something I never thought possible. The strategies I learned helped me grow fast, optimize my content, and turn my passion into a sustainable brand. If you’re serious about YouTube, this program is a must.

[p]This isn’t just a program—it’s a game-changer. It’s more than just learning the YouTube algorithm; it’s about joining a community of creators who actually understand your journey. If you're on day 10 or year 10 of YouTube, it doesn't matter, there’s always another level to unlock. CJS is the foundation I used and every YouTuber needs to grow, pivot, and thrive.

[p]The YouTube algorithm is CONSTANTLY CHANGING and it is my job to keep track of what those changes are so I can help my clients reach their goals. I have helped generate over 100 billion views and helped 34 different channels get more than 1 million subscribers each ... FROM SCRATCH. With a good plan and a little bit of knowledge, you can increase your chances of reaching your goals on YouTube ... and in life.
