[p]Sure, I was making good money, but I wasn't growing -
[strong]my business remained stubbornly stuck at 6 figures.
[strong]I tried everything I could think of
[p]- more ads, more messages, continuous posting on social media…
[p]But it was like pouring water into a basket.
[strong]Quitting my job to start internet marketing in 2021…
[p]I planned to own a business that would make me more money than I could ever get sitting at a desk working  9-5.
[p]I wanted a business that could pay for my trips to different parts of the world…

[span]5 Top
[strong]Internet Marketers are actively using to generate
[span]8-Figures yearly
[strong]on the internet using this system…
[p]And how you can combine them with this system to pump up your sales in your business.
[p]Hi,
[p]I'm
[strong]Margaret Ododo
[p], an 8-figure online entrepreneur with a passion for travel and adventure.
[p]I've coached over
[strong]500 satisfied students
[p], helping them achieve financial success and freedom through my proven marketing strategies and systems.
[p]As a successful business owner myself, I've made
[strong]over $25,000 in profits
[p]selling digital products and scaled my business to 8-figures in just
[strong]14 months.
[p]But like you already know, I didn't start out this way …
[p]You see, back in 2021 when I was tired of struggling as a broke architect and living from hand to mouth…
[p]My only option was to search for greener pastures outside my job and that's how I got into this internet marketing space…
[p]After struggling to move from 0 to 1 -
[strong]building a business from scratch to 6 figures.
[p]A few months down the line
[strong]I got stuck trying to scale…
[p]And I realized moving from 1-100 - 6 to 7 figures and above - was a whole new ball game.
[strong]Like most business owners I thought…
[em]"I just have to get more traffic, send a couple more messages and post a lot more right?"
[p]I was dead wrong.
[p]And here's why this doesn't work…
[p]Let's  say you're selling a product for a
[strong]₦20k profit
[p]You spend
[strong]₦100k
[p]to get 1000 leads
[p]Out of
[strong]1000 leads
[p], you get
[strong]10 sales
[p]making you
[strong]₦200k
[p]Now you double your ads spend hoping to make more sales and scale your business.
[p]This time, You spend
[strong]₦200k
[p]to get
[strong]2000 leads
[p]Out of
[strong]2000 leads
[p], you get
[strong]17 sales
[p]making you
[strong]₦340k
[p]Not bad right??
[p]Yes, that's what it looks like at first…
[p]But when you take a closer look at the numbers…
[p]You notice, in the beginning, you only spent
[strong]₦100k
[p]to make
[strong]₦200k
[p]But when you doubled your ad spend…
[p]For each
[strong]₦100k
[p]spent you only made
[strong]₦170k.
[strong]Basically, you're Spending More and Making Less
[p]And since I had a good traffic source and a solid offer that meant only one thing…
[strong]I had a Conversion Problem.
[p]And I found it to be true because when I doubled my leads…
[p]Being into WhatsApp marketing…
[p]Dealing with clients one on one was one of my struggles and this made me unable to give adequate attention to all my leads…
[strong]Ultimately costing me sales and reducing my conversions.
[p]Obviously, continuing like this will only produce worse results with time.
[p]When you have a conversion problem not only do you spend more and make less…
[p]You also lose sales to your competitors who are better at converting their leads to customers
[p]Making you feel frustrated and demotivated that your business is stagnant…
[p]Thinking you're just wasting your time and effort trying to scale.
[p]I knew I had to find a better way to attend to my leads and also increase my conversions.
[p]The solution?
[strong]I discovered the One-To-Many Marketing System called…
[strong]WEBINAR
[strong]The Exact System
[span]Top 1%
[strong]Internet Marketers use to
[span]10X, 20X
[strong]their sales and get  300%, 400%, and 500% Return On Ad Spends
[p]You see, a webinar is a simple video meeting you can organize for your potential customers to get a lot of them to buy from you in
[strong]90 mins or less
[p]and
[strong]boost your conversions.
[strong]And by plugging webinars into your business….
[span]You can get your customers to quickly know you like you and trust you so they can easily buy from you
[span]You can easily position yourself as an authority making them see you as an expert and easily believe what you say
[span]You can build real connections with your customers making them feel special - they won't just feel like potential customers you're trying to sell to through messages
[span]You can easily deal with thousands of potential customers all at the same time, saving you the time and stress of sending direct messages especially if you're into WhatsApp marketing
[p]Imagine the incredible feeling of interacting with a bunch of people who you've never met before and having them immediately buy from you.
[strong]Awesome right?
[p]I can understand if you're finding that hard to believe.
[p]But, do you remember when you walked into a store for the first time, simply because they had what you were looking for?
[p]You walked up to the owner to ask him more about the product you wanted.
[p]Then he started talking to you, and answering your questions…
[p]And as this goes on, you begin to know the kind of person he is…
[p]By the time you discover you like his attitude towards you and the attention he's giving you…
[p]You begin to feel you can trust him enough to take his word about the product.
[p]So you hand him your money and return home with your product feeling satisfied and happy with your purchase.
[p]And as you can see,  it didn't even take you up to 5 mins to hand over your money to a total stranger to get what you want…
[p]Why?
[p]Because the store owner was able to get you to know him like him and trust what he says in that short period.
[p]This is exactly how webinars work to make you significant sales from people you've never met before…
[p]I know  you're probably thinking
[strong]"But that only took 5 minutes"
[strong]So you're probably wondering…
[em]"Who would spend up to 90 minutes watching a webinar just because they want to buy something?"
[strong]And the answer is Nobody…
[p]But that's only if your webinar is boring and you don't give your leads anything to look forward to.
[p]If I turned on your favorite show for you right now…
[p]You'll agree with me that you would gladly spend time watching each one without bothering about the time…
[strong]Why?
[p]Because it has captured your attention and you're now interested in finding out
[strong]"what happens next".
[p]When you add this element of curiosity into a webinar and hook the attention of your leads giving them something to look forward to…
[p]You would see people gladly spend
[strong]up to 2 hours watching a webinar
[p], even if it's simply to satisfy their curiosity.
[p]And guess what?
[p]In a few moments, I'll show you a proven framework to set up a high-converting webinar that hooks the attention of your audience even if you have
[strong]ZERO Experience
[p]creating webinars.
[p]But first,
[p]Let me show you how webinars work to solve your conversion problem to help you scale up your business.
[p]Compared to when you make
[strong]10 sales
[p]from every
[strong]1000 leads
[p]that join your list which is basically a
[strong]1% conversion rate…
[p]When you put these same
[strong]1000 leads
[p]on a webinar - people who have never met you before - and even if you can only get
[strong]300
[p]of them to stay until the end…
[p]In under
[strong]90 minutes
[p]using a
[strong]high-converting webinar script
[p]you can close
[strong]30 sales
[p]out of the remaining
[strong]300 people
[p]and that's just a
[strong]10% conversion.
[strong]Don't believe me?
[p]Top Direct Response Marketer and Copywriter
[strong]Walter Enyinnaya
[p]one of the
[strong]Top  5 Internet Marketing Experts
[p]whose secret to making a minimum of
[strong]8-figures yearly
[p]with webinars I'll be sharing with you in a few minutes…
[p]Spent just
[strong]2
[strong]0 minutes
[p]on a webinar and hit a
[strong]10% conversion rate
[p]making double his ad spend back - meaning every other sale that came after was just pure profits.
[strong]And if you think 10% is amazing…
[p]Then you probably should know once you master creating a high-converting webinar, script, and offer
[p]You can even get conversions as high as
[strong]15-30%
[p]- that's between
[strong]150-300 sales
[p]from every
[strong]1000 people
[p]who get on your Webinar.
[p]Since he started using webinars, Top Internet Marketing Expert Toyin Omotoso says he's never had a conversion below
[strong]18%
[p]- that's
[strong]at least 180 sales
[p]from every
[strong]1000 persons
[p]who got on his webinar
[p]My good friend and  Top Internet Affiliate Marketer
[strong]Chigozie Mmebo hit a 31% conversion using  webinars
[p]And When I plugged webinars into my business….
[span]I went from struggling with low sales like this...
[strong]To making 150k  in 1 day
[strong]Then making 264k in 1 week
[strong]And as I got better at webinars, my sales and profits started increasing
[strong]And then I began to do over Half a Million in every week
[strong]Recently  hitting  a new milestone of 7-figures in a week
[p]Making massive sales consistently  like this also gave me the money, freedom and opportunity to travel around the world.
[strong]From going on a Vacation in Dubai
[strong]To meeting with Top Marketing Expert Toyin Omotoso - Founder of Expertnaire in Seychelles
[strong]Getting the chance to meet with my billionaire mentor and marketing expert Ronald Nzimora
[strong]And taking a beautiful  tour around the city of Kigali in Rwanda
[strong]And the best part is…
[strong]You can also plug webinars into your business right now
[p]and start making crazy sales…
[p]Just like Anya who was
[strong]struggling to pull past  5-figures
[p]when she started her internet marketing business
[strong]But after plugging this system into her business…
[strong]She can now  make half a million a week
[strong]She has broken the 6-figure barrier and is currently a 7-figure internet marketer, fast approaching 8-figures already at 4.5M in profit
[strong]Or like Henry who tried a webinar for the first time and made 7 sales despite having zero experience and only 10 people showing up.
[p]So you see, it's very easy for you to get a flood of sales and get great conversions with just one webinar.
[p]But just like Top  Marketing Expert
[strong]Ronald Nzimorah
[p]who sells both digital and physical products with webinars says…
[strong]Simply knowing about webinars is not enough to help you make it work and scale your business to 8-figures.
[p]You need to know how to make it work to avoid wasting resources going about it the wrong way when trying to
[strong]scale your business to 8-figures.
[p]That's why I came up with a proven framework any business owner can use to grow their internet marketing business to 8 figures using webinars.
[strong]A framework designed to show you how to…
[span]Get people to sign up and show up for your webinars.
[span]Hook the attention of your leads and make them look forward to seeing your offer at the end.
[span]Engage and Build desire for your offer without making your audience feel bored.
[span]Play the Game of Conversions after Webinar to boost your sales.
[p]Even though this framework had worked for me, I needed a way to make sure it would work for any business out there.
[strong]So to test this out…
[strong]I set up a 5-Day Webinar series
[p]where I shared my proven framework alongside the secrets of  5 Top Internet Marketing Experts to business owners struggling to grow their businesses.
[strong]Take a look  at the results these business owners got within a week of trying out this Proven framework
[strong]Stella ran a webinar and in just 2 hrs made 441k from selling out  21 slots for a 21k offer
[strong]Stella was able to find out live webinars worked best for her business
[strong]And She was so grateful at how much she had been able to transform her business with webinars in such a short time  that she sent this message
[strong]Abubakar was so glad to be able  to use Webinars to create more free time for himself and escape the stress of DM Marketing
[strong]Reuben who struggled to get people on his webinar to the end, had  122 people join his webinar, they all stayed to the end and he made 4 sales
[strong]This formula worked so well for Joshua that he was already raking in sales before his webinar started
[p](and I'll show you how you can do it too in the next few minutes)
[p]Seeing how this proven framework had transformed their businesses through Webinars…
[p]I was sure I had found…
[strong]The  True Secret  To Making Massive Sales and Successfully Scale Any Business  On The Internet -
[span]The Smart Way.
[p]In addition to giving you this proven framework and the secrets 5 Top Internet Marketers currently use to rake in sales in webinars…
