[p]"If you spend an evening with the FroKnowsPhoto Guide to DSLR Video, you'll save time and money trying to understand the film industry. I've earned two degrees from Full Sail University and I learned as much from Todd & Fro in one night as any course in my alma matar. This instructional series gives you the confidence to know you can take on a project and have an understanding of what you're doing."

[p]As a lifelong photographer I know what it’s like to be frustrated by the quality of your videos. You’re dealing with the same concepts and settings -- like shutter speed, ISO, and aperture -- but the rules are completely different. When I first started shooting video I got frustrated pretty quickly when I couldn’t figure everything out, despite my years of photography experience.
[p]Searching for information only led to more questions, years of painfully slow learning and endless hours of experimentation that gave me so-so results for a LONG time…
[p]After the last 4 years of shooting and producing my own videos, I know firsthand how much there is to learn and how difficult it is to find the RIGHT information that helps you get better instead of worse. It honestly took me years to learn all of the secrets, techniques, and concepts that go into shooting world class videos.
[p]I don’t want that for you though.
[div]What if you could take a massive shortcut and get ALL of the information you need to shoot video in a matter of days instead of years?
[p]What if you could learn exactly how an award winning filmmaker and photographer shoot, produce, direct, and edit breathtaking HD videos using an entry level DSLR?
[p]What if you could look behind the scenes, follow them on video shoots to learn their secrets, and see exactly how to do it for yourself...all at the same time?
[p]With the brand new FroKnowsPhoto Guide to shooting Video you can do all of this and much, much more with ANY DSLR that shoots video.
[p]This guide will introduce you to our “one man band” concept which means that you will be able to:
[li]Easily shoot, direct, produce, and edit videos on your own without a crew or any extra help
[li]Create breathtaking videos, even if you have an entry level camera and no expensive equipment (even if you’re on a shoestring budget, you can do everything we teach)
[li]Create dynamic scenes, tell inspiring stories, and capture high quality video
[h1]This guide was carefully designed to be invaluable to professional, hobbyist, and newbie photographers alike
[p]Whether you just bought your first DSLR or you’re a seasoned photographer that wants a fast and systematic approach to DSLR video, this guide is going to be extremely valuable to you.
[p]Do you want to shoot video like a pro?
[p]Have you ignored video because you don’t know exactly how to setup your camera, audio, lighting, or video shoots?
[p]Have you had a DSLR for awhile but haven’t ventured into shooting video because you’re not happy with the results you’ve been getting?
[p]Or, do you just think video is too expensive and complicated to produce?
[p]If you answered yes to any of the above questions then I have some GREAT news:
[p]It doesn’t matter if you want to make more money with your DSLR by shooting professional videos like interviews, electronic press kits, music videos and movies…
[p]Or you just want to shoot better videos of your kids sporting events...your sisters wedding...or your own passion projects...this new guide has you covered.
[p]The FroKnowsPhoto Guide to Shooting Video will give you all of the tools you need to shoot…

[p]Videos
[h1]+ Much, much more!
[p]After 4 years of creating over 1,700 YouTube videos and two full training guides I’ve gotten A LOT of questions about how I shoot, produce, direct, and edit my videos. In fact, so many of my readers requested more training on my DSLR video process that I decided to put together my most comprehensive guide yet...
[p]I partnered up with my good friend and award winning filmmaker Todd Wolfe to create the most comprehensive system for learning DSLR video I’ve ever created: the FroKnowsPhoto Guide to Shooting Video.
[p]This guide is going to help you:
[li]Learn the entire process of shooting any type of video from start to finish (with step-by-step detailand real world examples)
[li]Shoot high quality videos of ANYTHING you can imagine - our rules and secrets apply to virtuallyevery type of video!
[li]Shave months or years of time off the process of learning to shoot solid video of anything
[li]Discover the secrets of shooting video straight from an award winning filmmaker and photographer
[li]Learn from someone who focuses on just video and someone who has successfully transitioned fromstills to video
[p]In this guide Todd and I dissect the ENTIRE process of shooting, lighting, capturing audio, and directing videos shot with a DSLR camera. We break down everything into easy to follow steps that anyone can learn from, whether you’re a seasoned pro or a complete newbie.

[p]This guide should be priced higher, especially with the amount of content you get
[p]“I’ve never had the guts to shoot video with my DSLR. Although I am a very confident photographer, not knowing how the same settings in photography relate to video made my attempts at shooting very amateur.
[p]This guide has given me confidence to go out and shoot video as I needed to learn the settings due to work offering video options to clients so this guide will allow me to earn extra money when out on the job.
[span]This guide should be priced higher, especially with the amount of content you get and the quality of it is outstanding.”

[p]Here’s an overview of what you’ll find in the first section:
[h1]Camera Basics For Video
[p]Whether you have a Full Frame, Cropped Sensor, Mirrorless or Micro 4/3rds camera the same camera basic rules apply.
[p]The goal of this section is to quickly refresh some best practices when venturing into shooting video.
[p]A few of the secrets waiting for you in this section…

[li]The definitive guide to different sensor sizes, including the pros and cons of each
[li]Our best practices to avoid issues when on shoots (most people completely overlook these)
[h1]The Importance of Frame Rate
[p]Frame rate is one of the most important settings for DSLR video. Many cameras offer you 24, 30 and 60 fps but if you don’t choose wisely you might not capture the video you were looking for. In this section you will see us use Hungry Hungry Hippos to demonstrate the differences between the frame rates.
[p]A few of the secrets waiting for you in this section…

[p]A few of the secrets waiting for you in this section…

[p]Buying this guide for $197 is a bargain, getting it for $97 is a steal!
[p]I work in the casino gaming industry and for years have had a vision to make a training video dealing with proper procedure, guest service and tips for dealing casino games. With this video I feel as though I have a good foundation to achieve this goal. The guide is easy to understand and both you and Todd do a fantastic job relaying the information.
[span]Buying this guide for $197 is a bargain, getting it for $97 is a steal!
[p]Thanks again for all that you do for the photo community.

[p]In the FroKnowsPhoto Guide to DSLR Video you’ll also get to…
[li]Look behind our cameras and see our exact settings on each shoot (we can’t make it any easier than this)
[li]See exactly how every video setting looks in every combination (this section is an eye opener)
[li]Follow us on four different video shoots so you can see the ENTIRE process start to finish
[p]And here’s what you’re going to get access to in the second section:
[h1]The Mystery of the Video Exposure Triangle Revealed
[p]Yes there is an exposure triangle for video just like photo. In fact it’s made up of the same elements but they act differently for video. Even if you have a handle on your exposure triangle for video you’re going to want to see the differences in action so you don’t make any of these common exposure mistakes.
[p]A few of the secrets waiting for you in this section…
[li]Why a basic kit lens with a slower aperture may be easier when attempting to follow focus
[li]The exact parts of the exposure triangle you should focus on locking in (this is different than with stills)
[li]Our video exposure triangle demonstration where you get to visually see the “cause and effect” when we make changes
[h1]How Shutter Speed Is Different For Video
[p]Shutter Speed is directly tied into your frame rate but if you are coming from the stills world you have to know that shutter speed does more than just let more light in or cut back on light. There is no better way to see this in action than to watch the section where we show a metronome at different shutter speeds.
[p]A few of the secrets waiting for you in this section…
[li]Our “rule of thumb” to determine your exact shutter speed in comparison to your frame rate in under 10 seconds (this works every time!)
[li]The differences between shutter speed for photos and video (many new videographers take months or years to really understand this)
[li]What happens if you break the rules and shoot at a much faster shutter speed
[h1]Aperture
[p]Yes it controls the amount of light and depth of field but selecting the proper aperture will play a major part in how well you can “Follow Focus” to help you get that tack sharp video. The best way to see this in action is to watch us at the piano tickling the ivory.
[p]A few of the secrets waiting for you in this section…
[li]Our simple and easy to remember advice for making sure your videos are ALWAYS in focus
[li]How to tell if you should shoot wide open vs. closed down
[li]Our selective focus method that makes your videos even more interesting
[h1]ISO
[p]Sometimes you just have to ride your ISO up or down to allow your shutter speed and aperture to work with the frame rate you chose. This plays a major role in the final quality of your video and whether or not you need to bring in more lighting.
[p]A few of the secrets waiting for you in this section…
[li]How we determine how high or low of an ISO to use in each shot
[li]One simple adjustment that will allow you to dramatically lower your ISO
[li]How you can use higher ISO to gain the “artistic look”
[h1]Why Are Picture Styles Important?
[p]How much work do you want to do in post? Can your computer handle all the processing needed to do color correcting of a “flat” picture style? Our DSLR’s are not capturing RAW video (yet) so we have to pay very close attention to how we set our picture controls.
[p]A few of the secrets waiting for you in this section…
[li]Our top tips and tricks for making sure your picture style is always set properly
[li]Todd’s “safeguards” to make sure you don’t set your styles wrong (this will avoid a lot of frustration and headaches in post production)
[li]Todd and Jared’s technique to visually see the difference between an acceptable picture style and one that’s not even close
[h1]How to Stabilize Your Camera
[h1](Camera Supports)

[li]How you can get stable video every time, even with no budget for more equipment
[li]Our favorite techniques to utilize the gear you already have to stabilize your video

[h1]Finally Understand Audio Capture
[h1](Get This Right or Your Video is Trash)
[p]Quite possibly the most important part of your video has nothing to do with actual video, it’s audio. You could have the best looking video in the world but if it sounds terrible no one will watch it. This section will take the guess work out of how to set your audio levels.  This is one thing I struggled with for a long time when first when I started shooting DSLR video. No matter what situation you will be in we have you covered with demonstrations.

Many of the rules of composition for photography still hold true with video but with some important additions to pay close attention to. You’ll get to learn all about coverage and why is it important since it’s the glue that holds your videos together.
[p]You want to make sure you come back with all the footage options you need...wide shots, medium, tight, OTS or over the shoulder. Getting this just right helps tell your story which is key for creating videos people love to watch.

[p]A few of the secrets waiting for you in this section…
[li]Why it’s critical to pay attention to seemingly minor details from scene-to-scene
[li]How to help your audience better understand the world you’re creating in your videos
[li]A walkthrough on how to tie together coverage and continuity to make your viewers feel immersed in the scene
[h1]The 180 Degree Rule
[p]All I can say is I messed this up once and it will never happen again. There is a very specific reason this is a rule and why we spend so much time explaining and demonstrating it.
[p]A few of the secrets waiting for you in this section…
[li]A crash course on the 180 rule and why you need to follow it strictly
[li]How to avoid confusing the people watching your video

[p]This video guide is built for everyone, the beginner or advanced user can learn from the teachings in this guide...
[p]“I have been fond of Jared’s teaching style with photography and with Todd at his side am now fond of his teaching style with video. Todd brings a dynamic look at how you can create a very cinematic feel with just changing the angle a bit, and how important filler video shots can be when working in post-production. That’s right they even touch on the things that make a great video outside of just equipment and lighting.

[p]This guide goes further than just basic camera settings but also goes in depth into film making...
[p]“My expectation going into this was that Jared was going to simply teach us the technical side of camera settings for shooting dslr video, but what I got was that and so much more! This guide goes further than just basic camera settings but also goes in depth into film making.
[p]Jared and Todd(Wolfe) do a good job of not only showing the DSLR tools and accessories that they suggest, but showing why they suggest it, and how they would use it. Just when you think there isn't anything more that they could add, they take you on 4 video shoots and show you how it is all put together.”

[p]Who are Jared Polin and Todd Wolfe?
[p]My name is Jared Polin aka the FRO and I’m the founder of FroKnowsPhoto.com. Since 2010 I have been creating fun and informative educational videos that have helped hundreds of thousands of photographers and videographers around the world improve their camera skills.
[p]I’ve been a professional photographer since i was 15 years old and During my career I’ve shot photos for Rolling Stone, the Philadelphia Flyers, Perry Farrell of Janes Addiction, Matisyahu, and hundreds of other well known musicians, tech visionaries, business owners and celebrities.
[p]Since the introduction of DSLR’s with the ability to capture video, I have been making the transition into film making. The great part about learning video as a photographer is you have a jump start on someone who has to start from scratch. If you’re a photographer you already have a basic understanding of the fundamentals that go into capturing video so you have a great head start but most likely need proper guidance to shoot GREAT videos.
[p]Seeing so many of you make huge strides in your career as a photographer - whether you’re a hobbyists or professional - is the most rewarding thing in the world to me. I can’t wait to hear about your success with the FroKnowsPhoto Guide to DSLR Video.

[span]($67 value)
[p]Shooting the video is only half the battle - a lot of videographers struggle when it comes to editing and sink way too much time into the process.

The Editing Tips bonus is a full on guide that shows you some of Todd’s best tips for editing videos that he picked up over the years as a professional filmmaker and producer.

[span]Q: What if I’m brand new to videography/photography?
[span]A:
[p]The FroKnowsPhoto Guide to DSLR Video covers all of the bases, meaning that you can start creating your own high quality videos after watching this guide even if you just got your first DSLR today.
[span]Q: What if I can’t afford the equipment?
[span]A:
[p]We designed this guide to be applicable to any photographer/videographer, even on the most shoestring of budgets. Whenever we introduce new equipment we show you low cost alternatives all the way up to the professional equipment so there will always be an option for any budget.
[span]Q: Do I need a camera that shoots video to learn from this?
[span]A:
[p]No you don't need a camera that shoots video to learn from this guide but we highly recommend that you have the ability to capture video somehow with a DSLR so you can put our teachings into practice.
[span]Q: I am a seasoned professional photographer, won't I be able to shoot video already?
[span]A:
[p]The transition for you as a seasoned professional photographer will be much easier but the fundamentals of capturing video with your DSLR are much different than when shooting stills.
[p]When I started shooting videos with my DSLR I thought I should set everything just like I do for stills, boy was I wrong.  There are a lot of different settings that you need pay attention do that you didn’t have to with stills.
[p]All I can say is I wish I had this guide when I first attempted to shoot video.  It’s going to get you shooting quality video in no time.
[span]Q: Do I need expensive lenses to shoot video?
[span]A:
[p]No, if you have kit lenses to start, that is perfectly fine for learning and creating solid video.  In fact, in the original FroKnowsPhoto Guide To Getting Out Of Auto Todd used a few zoom kit lenses when filming me on photo shoots.
[span]Q: What camera was Todd using when shooting his videos?
[span]A:
[p]Todd is using a 5 year old consumer level body in the way of the Canon 60D. This is a cropped sensor camera that sells today for only $600.
[p]The truth of the matter is Todd still uses this consumer level camera on paying jobs which proves that it’s not always about the gear.
[span]Q: Do you offer a one on one mentorship for learning DSLR Video?
[span]A:
[p]As of right now we do not. In the future we may offer in person boot camps but as of now the easiest and fastest way to learn video with your DSLR is to watch this guide.
[span]Q. What format is the DVD package in and does it come with the data disc as well?
[span]A:
[p]The DVD's are in NTSC but most dvd and blu-ray players are able to handle multiple formats.  The discs are region free as well.  The DATA disc is also included in the dvd package so you get the digital files.
