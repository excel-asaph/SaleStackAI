[span]SO YOU'VE BEEN POSTING YOUTUBE VIDEOS
[span]FOR A WHILE NOW...
[span]You've watched all the strategy videos...
[span]Could one more class really make a difference?
[span]I know you're busy. Jumping on a live class for an hour may seem impossible with your kids, your work schedule, your errands...
[span]I bet you've also been saying the same thing about starting your YouTube channel... "I just don't have the time or energy today," or "I need to do more research first, then I can do this."
[span]So here's the not so gentle nudge...
[span]It's time to stop putting off your goals. Stop putting off that dream. Stop delaying the future you could be creating for yourself and your family.
[span]This class is just a first step, but it's an important one.
[span]Set an hour aside to join this class and learn what you need to do to start and grow on YouTube the RIGHT WAY.
[span]Then we'll help you take the next step. And the next step... until you reach your goals.

[span]This is just going to be a waste of time..."
[span]When I started shooting videos for my church youth group in 2003… I never believed it would have turned into this.
[span]3 Million Subscribers. WHOA.
[span]It took over 18 years to get here, and it’s been a bumpy road of HIGHS and LOWS.
[span]When Think Media started, the whole nation was suffering from an economic crash. We were losing our home and defaulting on our rental property. The church I was working at fell apart after a scandal where senior leadership stole money.
[span]Loaded with over $600,000 of debt and having nothing to show for it - I turned to the one thing I knew best. Video.
[span]At that point, I had a small YouTube channel, and most people would see the first Amazon affiliate payout I made of $2.12 as a waste of time… but I saw it as a seed of hope for the future.
[span]With no certainty or roadmap for how YouTube worked… I committed to learning the game of online video and online business.
[span]All based on the simple hunch that this thing would be here for the long haul.

[span]"This is going to be really hard."
[span]The side-hustle-struggle is real. During those early years I worked in food service at a burger joint and an espresso stand, I led the media department of a church in Las Vegas, I was a pastor for a year and half -- and the whole time I’d do video and photography jobs on the side for freelance clients.
[span]That didn’t leave much time for YouTube. But I stayed focused and used whatever extra time and energy I had to post videos and study.
[span]2015 brought on brand new struggles, at that time I was earning my living from working with freelance clients -- but in one month I was fired by all-of-them losing 90% of my families income in a matter of weeks.
[span]So I had a choice to make: Look for new clients OR go all-in with my YouTube channel and see if I could do this full-time.
[span]It was November 2015. I had built up Think Media to 16,000 subscribers. And I made the decision, excited and scared to death. I’m going all-in.
[span]I didn’t know exactly what it would look like at the time, but I knew I needed to find a way to make YouTube work for me no matter what life threw at my family.
