[p]In Just A Moment, You’ll Discover How A New Technique –
[strong]REVERSE REALTY ADVERTISING –
[p]Can Give You An
[strong]Unfair Advantage
[p]To Earn
[strong]Millions In Commissions Selling Real Estate
[p]From Anywhere You Are In The World ~ In Under 30 days!
[p]Read that again, and let it sink in.
[p]Dear Realtor,
[p]My name is Godson, and in case we are meeting for the first time, I’m one of the leading Internet marketing consultants in Nigeria.
[p]I have been consulted by
[strong]top real estate companies and realtors
[p]to give them a winning edge in the world of selling property
[p]Some of these folks you know who are making millions in commission are following a strict Internet marketing recipe
[p]Prepared by yours truly.
[p]I’m not saying all that to boast… but so that
[strong]you can be confident
[p]that everything you are about to read would definitely help you get the results you seek.
[p]Which are… to get more leads and close more deals
[p]And ultimately lead to
[strong]a life of true financial freedom
[p]A life where you never have to worry about money again.
[p]But first you must accept one simple reality…
[strong]If you want to get rich selling real estate, you don’t get rich by selling more property,
[p]You get rich by
[em]selling a few luxury property
[p].
[p]It’s true. Look at the math:
[p]To make a commission of N2,000,000 monthly…
[p]You can either:
[p]– Sell 20 property with a commission of 100,000 or
[p]– Sell 10 with a commission of 200,000 or
[p]– Sell 5 with a commission of 400,000 or
[p]– Sell 2 luxury property with a commission of 1,000,000 each
[p]I’m guessing just by looking at that list, you already know that it’s going to be more difficult trying to sell 20 properties for N100k commission each month
[p]So logically, the fewer the property you need to sell to hit your income goals, the greater your chances of reaching them.
[p]And the fact is that,
[strong]it is easier
[p]than you think to sell luxury property.
[strong]A few realtors
[strong]I’ve worked with make N10,000,000+ (10 million) in commissions
[p]per property
[p]So I know exactly what I am talking about.
[p]And you are about to see that soon.
[p]Now,
[strong]the problem
[p]with selling luxury property is that…
[p]It is
[em]difficult
[p]for a realtor to break into the circle of super rich & affluent clients without connections …or at least a referral.
[p]For instance.
[p]How do you get across and connect with a class of people who can – without over thinking or excessive haggling…
[strong]doll out 100, 200, and even 500 million to purchase a property
[strong]Do you send them DM’s on LinkedIn?
[p]They may not respond and even if they did, it likely won’t develop into anything meaningful.
[p]You’d look spammy. They already receive a ton of those.
[p]So…
[strong]Do you attend every “top” event to connect with them?
[p]This might work, but not quite as you’d imagine, because most of your complimentary cards would end up in the bin
[p]Finally…
[strong]What about referrals… this should work right?
[p]Referrals are great… but when it comes to getting referrals to the super rich, you need to have your skin long in the game, gradually walking your way up.
[p]And that usually takes a lot of time to build (many years). It’s also not a consistent or predictable way for getting deal makers monthly.
[p]So the question remains…
[h2]How Can
[strong]A Realtor With
[em]Zero Connection And Influence
[h2], Break Into A Circle Of Super-Rich Prospects Looking To Buy Property?
[em]Well,
[p]The answer is to…
[p]Stop looking for them. Instead, get them to look for you.
[p]We do this using a system I call –
[strong]Reverse Realty Advertising (RRA)
[p]You see, the traditional way of selling Real Estate have limited results because there, you are chasing prospects.
[p]You have to reverse the situation, so it is them chasing you.
[p]As you would imagine…
[strong]this make closing deals – faster, easier and stress free.
[p]So instead of jumping through hoops in search of clients,
[p]You’d be having pressure-free closing conversations with prospects who have indicated that they are
[strong]cash ready to buy
[p]your properties.
[p]If you are wondering
[strong]how it works
[p], just let me explain…
[em]RRA (Reverse Realty Advertising)
[p]is a
[strong]combination of two
[p]powerful techniques,
[p]I have never openly shared these except with my consulting clients (who retain my services for several thousands of dollars)
[em]The first technique
[p]reveals 4 NEW Facebook and Instagram ad targeting strategies to reach ONLY super rich people who can spend 50m to 500 million+ on property investments
[em](I promise you, you won’t find this anywhere else… )
[p]And
[strong]the second technique
[p]is my very own signature lead generation system that
[em]qualifies
[p]and
[em]pre-frames
[p]these leads so they are primed, ready to close.
[p]By pre-frame, I mean – it sets them in buying mode.
[p]Once you set up your ads using any the 4 simple targeting techniques I’ll show you, and send that HIGH QUALITY TRAFFIC to the lead generation system…
[strong]It would look as though, you are getting personal request from multi-millionaires and even billionaires… in desperate need of a property.
[strong]I know you may have tried to run ads on Facebook, Instagram or Property websites without much luck in the past – but I tell you –
[p]Once you discover how this is done, you’ll never want to return to your old ways of selling, ever again.
[p]Having taught these to my clients privately, I recently decided that
[strong]it was time to take the impact far
[p]and wide by creating a video course I’ve named –
[strong]Superior Lead Generation for Realtors
[p]And by the time I was done distilling the full information into this course,
[p]I knew I had created one of the tools that
[strong]God will use to raise a new set of Multi-millionaire realtors
[p](and even greater…)
[p]I know you can’t wait to get your hands on this system, but before I show you how,
[strong]Come with me let me show you just a fraction of what you would get inside…
[li]3 NEW Facebook/IG Ad strategies for
[strong]targeting super-rich real estate prospects
[li](HINT: Copy key, Hotspot, and more extra targeting methods)
[em]and…
[li]How to use Inverse targeting to
[strong]target Nigerians in Diaspora
[li]who are interested in buying property back home
[strong]The right way to setup Real Estate Ads on Facebook/
[li]Instagram to hook and engage the right audience (This might be the singular reason why your previous ads didn’t yield results)
[strong]That is just the beginning,
[p]you will also Discover –
[li]How to
[strong]set up your own real estate funnel
[li](with little to no extra cost) ~ in under 5 minutes
[li]How to run ads for up to 10 properties in one (1) ad
[strong](Make the most of your ad spend while getting better results!)
[li]How to use
[strong]retargeting ads to follow-up
[li]and remind high-intent prospects to take action (by the way these are very cheap & super effective!)
[li]And lot’s
[em]lot’s more…
[p]Once you get a hold of the truths I teach in this course and apply it
[strong]You’ll be on your way to making cool millions every month.
[p]But it is NOT for everyone…
[p]If you are –
[span]– Looking for a
[strong]get rich quick scheme
[span]or
[p]–
[strong]A magic wand that does all the work
[p]for you, while you sit back and earn
[p]–
[strong]A freeloader, who likes to get something for nothing
[p]and cannot invest money into purchasing resources that add value to your business
[p]Then stay away. I refuse and I’m not willing to help you, because what I teach won’t work for you.
[strong]This is for action takers
[p], who want to put
[strong]their future and finances in their firm control
[p]– and are willing to pay any price for it
[p]If you fit into the last category I just described, then come with me let’s talk about the price for the training.
[h2]How Much Does It Cost… Or Rather – How Much Is It Worth?
[p]That was real question…
[p]Let me ask you again:
[strong]What is this system worth to you?
[p]A system that can help you –
[li]Get more leads and
[strong]close more deals
[li]easily
[li]Become
[strong]financially free,
[li]a position where you can
[em](without stress)
[li]support your loved ones
[strong]Live your dream and best life
[li], spending your time doing what you love
[li]Become a
[strong]prominent figure
[li]in your industry that everyone else looks up to
[strong]Afford your dream car,
[li]house, and set you in a position where you never have to worry about money again.
[p]It’s got to be worth a lot to you, I guess.
[p]It should be expensive.
[p]At the barest minimum,
[strong]we should price this for N150,000.
[p]But you won’t pay that if you order now.

[h2]Is This For You?
[p]Now listen, if you haven’t enrolled yet, I really want to talk to you because, as great as this course is, I understand it’s absolutely not for everybody.
[strong]I really want you to be sure this is right for you when you enroll today
[p]That’s why we should take a minute and just go through the pros and cons of what we’re about to do together.
[p]The pros are
[strong]it’s a proven method
[p], My clients have been using it. I have a lot of experience in this one. I know what works, I know what doesn’t.
[p]Another pro to this is
[strong]you don’t need to close many deals
[p]to hit your financial goals (like I explained earlier)
[p]Another pro is that
[strong]you won’t need to spend a ton of money running ads
[p]because you don’t need that much traffic.
[strong]You don’t need to have any previous knowledge
[p]about setting up online advertising systems (because this is a practical course),
[strong]You don’t need to sell hard or make a gazillion follow-up calls, or suffer a “billion” rejections
[p]because henceforth
[em],
[em]your leads would be primed to close
[strong]before you even get a chance to call.
[strong]Listen, it’s not all roses, not everything’s perfect in this.
[p]For example, I admit this isn’t the cheapest thing in the world. “This is an expensive training
[em](for some)
[p].”
[p]Also, this is going to take a pretty significant investment of time for you.
[p]We have an investment of money & time and it’s not overnight. You have to work pretty hard to do this.
[p]If you don’t have the time to do it, it’s not going to be of any benefit to you.”
[p]Of course, there’s also always the question of,
[strong]“What if it doesn’t work for me?”
[p]Well, fact of the matter is it might not.
[strong]If you’re not willing to work hard,
[p]if you’re not willing to advertise, if you’re not willing to follow directions, if you’re not willing to stick through the inevitable challenges, it definitely won’t work for you and you shouldn’t enroll.
[p]Well, you know, if after looking at all of this and if it looks like this makes sense to you. Then you really need to
[strong]go ahead and enroll in the training today
[p]and don’t forget we’ve got bonuses and the offer is going to expire.

[li]or being able to generate tons of
[strong]super-rich leads
[li]already primed to close?
[span]N136
[li]or
[strong]making more money
[li]in a month (from commissions) than most people make in a year?
[span]N136
[li]or the ease of closing property deals fast and

[span]N136
[p]to cover your first day if it’s that big of a deal to you.
