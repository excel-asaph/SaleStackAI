[strong]To prove that to you, just see some of my receipt screenshot below.
[p]Lets get this straight here.
[p]Unless you are living on Mars or Jupiter, you should know that there is a looming global economic recession.
[p]If you are in Africa then, you can relate with this properly because There is a serious price hike of goods and services, increase of unemployment, and the poverty level is increasing without control.
[p]Coming down to Nigeria where I am from, it’s getting worse especially due to subsidy removal, and some governmental policies.
[p]The minimum wage is still stagnant, so not being enough to match the rate of inflation.

[p]Maybe you want to make money to fund your school, vision, and passion and start living the life of your dreams.

[p]I am 100% sure because I have done everything I’m about to show you, made my mistakes, gathered my experiences, and made massive wins.
[span]Hey awesome person
[p]My name is Esther Amaka
[p]I’m considered as one of the fastest rising female affiliate marketer in Nigeria. Some call me an underdog who rose to stardom.
[p]I have gone from zero to 20 million naira in sales in 11 months.
[div]But all these were not so a year ago.
[p]You see, before I came across this business model, I was a young struggling girl who hustled everyday just to feed myself, and at least change my dress.
[p]I sold cheap clothes on my whatsapp status, and that was the only source of my livelihood. I would place orders from shops or in rare times travel to lagos or onitsha market to get clothes myself to sell.
[p]Life was not easy, at all.
[p]I would post on my status, and rely on status view to sell my market.
[p]Most of them will come and price, and go mute again.
[p]Some that will decide to buy will want you to sell at cost price.
[p]I had my fair share of the trenches.
[p]One day, I decided that I needed to upgrade my income because I was tired of the hand to mouth kind of life.
[p]I saw that Crypto was trending, and people were making millions overnight.
[p]It caught my fancy, and I decided to give it a shot.
[p]I packed all my savings, about 300k, and gave out to trade crypto.
[p]Within months, my capital and everything vanished into thin air.
[p]I almost had heart attack
[p]Few months later, I gathered my pieces and started from rock bottom again.
[p]This cycle continued
[strong]until I heard about affiliate marketing in 2022.
[p]Once again, I was skeptical, and feared I would lose everything again but somehow, I gathered the morale and decided to go all in.
[p]In the beginning, it was very tough.
[p]But I was able to make my first sale 3 weeks later.
[p]It wasn’t a lot of money though, but at least i could see the light at the end of the tunnel
[div]Fast forward till today, I have won many massive cash awards.
[div]I have won a car, and all paid trips to Maldives. (I did not go because of my exams in school)
[p]All these i have done even as a 400 level student in the university
[p]Plus, I have trained warrior students who are making large sums for themselves using the secret strategy i am about to show you now.
[div]I’m sure by now you can agree with me that t
[span]his business model can change your life forever,
[div]turn you from a zero to a millionaire.
[strong]So now we are on the same page now right?
[p]I know you will be asking, what is this business model i’m talking about
[p]Well to kill your curiosity, this business model is called AFFILIATE MARKETING.
[p]But wait a moment, what is affiliate marketing, and how does it work?
[p]Affiliate marketing is simply selling other people’s high quality products, and earning a commission after making a sale.
[h2]Still sounds confusing, yeah?
[p]Of course you know for sure that before you can make money online or even offline, there must be an exchange of value.
[p]So what happens is that you find a product that will really solve people’s problem, and help them get from point A to point B. Sell it to them, and once you do, you will be paid a commission.
[p]Please note, this is not network marketing where you bring one person to bring another.
[p]You sell a product, and earn a commission, simple.
[p]All you need to do is find these top notch products, find the people who need them, and sell to them.
[p]Sounds super simple yeah?
[p]That’s just the easiest part though.
[p]The heavy lifting is actually finding where these people are that need these products in their numbers, and selling to them consistently.
[p]This is where a lot of people, especially newbies get it wrong.
[p]This is also the missing piece that separates millionaire affiliates from mediocre affiliates.
[p]Trust me, the last thing you want to do at this point is to browse on google about how to get started or watch youtube videos that will waste your data and teach you nothing.
[p]or worst go and buy courses randomly from unverified tutors that have no track record, or want to use newbies as lab rats.
[p]Just like me, you will end up burning out a lot of cash and you will still be frustrated.
[p]That is why i have created this course
