[h1]WHAT IS IT?
[p]What if you and your team had the skills to write copy that would consistently crush conversions … even from cold traffic?
[p]Now, imagine how quickly you could scale your business, and your client’s businesses, if every ad, every sales page, every message was compliant with Facebook, Google, Instagram, LinkedIn, YouTube and any other online media platform you choose to advertise with … the first time it is submitted for review.
[p]That’s what is possible when you have a team of
[em]High Income Copywriters
[p].
[h1]WHY IS THIS RELEVANT?
[p]Every business wants more customers, correct? Customers are the lifeblood of a business. But it is getting harder and harder to attract and convert new customers online.
[p]Not only from rising ad costs, increased competition, and the decline in organic social media reach …
[p]But also because … copywriting has changed.
[p]The traditional copywriting methods which have been used for decades worked great for print ads and sales pages in the early years of online marketing.
[p]Long copy, bold claims, crazy promises … and in no uncertain terms … telling the reader what to do and what they will achieve.
[p]This is the
[strong]Old Copywriting Model
[p]most copywriters still use today. Take a quick look around on the internet; you will find it almost everywhere.
[strong]But here is the problem.
[p]The Social Media and Search Engine giants that control the advertising space online don’t like the
[strong]Old Copywriting Model
[p].
[p]They restrict what you can say, how you say it and the claims and promises you can make. Failure to abide by their rules can result in your account being suspended or worse, shut down.
[p]Copywriters and business owners who persist in following the
[strong]Old Copywriting Model
[p]are fighting a losing battle.
[p]In short … The
[strong]Old Copywriting Model
[p]is dead if you want to successfully market your products or services online and quickly scale your business.
[p]To be successful, your team must develop the skills of the
[strong]New Copywriting Model
[p], which can only be learned in the
[em]High Income Copywriter™
[strong]Certification Program
[p].
[p]You see human psychology and the way people make a buying decision hasn’t changed, but the way the copy is consumed has changed.
[p]As a
[em]High Ticket Copywriter™
[p], you will have the skill to write copy that engages, persuades and converts cold traffic on social media into a customer without dealing with the knock-backs from the advertising platforms because your copy isn’t compliant.
[p]This is a very valuable skill to have and is in high demand from a seemingly endless number of businesses on the internet.
[p]Imagine the possibilities for your business if your entire team were Certified
[em]High Ticket Copywriter™
[p].

[b]High Income Copywriter
[p]I'm a student for over 2 years now.
[br]Have done HTC before which have changed my life.
[br]HIC is a great value for money.
[br]I'm only half way through and I have already started to understand the structure of a copy.
[br]First off all it helps you change your mind set which is probably the thing we have to work harder  at the beginning.
[br]Learning takes time and efforts which I could never imagine before I started.
[br]The good thing is that we have to copy the masters for the first few years before we can create our own style.
[br]And sifu Dan have given plenty of material to copy.
[br]Thank you again sifu Dan and his team for all the support.
[br]Have done courses before with other mentors  but I find the support team  better then the others.
[br]They will be next to you anytime you need.
[br]Most off the time acting proactive.
[br]Thank you

[b]Become the person I can be
[p]For a long time I use to think my only why was to help my family and get a new job, but recently IÕve dug deep and found out my true whyÉ
[p]That is to be the person not only I thought or think I could be but what others know I could be as well.
[p]IÕve always thought that I was suppose to do more then most in my family, but seemed to fall just shortÉ
[p]After reading ÒThink and Grow RichÓ I found out what has happened. I fail then quit, that was it but I found that with copywriting and from Sifu all failure is is feedback and that as changed my life.
[p]Now I take all the feedback and use it to better myself and become the person I know I can and others know I should be.

[b]Don't give up. Copy and HIC are powerful
[p]3 years ago I enrolled in HIC. Yesterday I hit my first $10K month.
[p]Sifu Dan Lok, I will always be grateful to you and this community. My wife and I did 8 trips around Europe this year alone, and live in one of the fanciest neighborhoods in Lisbon (Portugal), because of Copywriting alone (6 months ago I told her to retire and focus on her passion, photography).
[p]3 years ago I literally couldn't pay for groceries, was living in a 'Gotham-like' city in Colombia, and had $40k in debt.
[p]I don't say this to impress you, but to impress upon you that... Copy and HIC are powerful. Don't give up!!

[b]Copywriting saves lives!
[p]I just received the news that one video I created for an NGO (using copywriting principles) got them a $35,000 grant. This money will allow them to renew the equipment of an old hospital in the country side of Colombia - and save hundreds of lives
[p]Here are 3 things I did:
[p]1- Used storytelling to connect emotionally FIRST before trying to pitch anything.
[p]2- Focused on ONE character - a male peasant who was hit by a car, because the cities are SO overpopulated that they are invading the country side
[p]3- I introduced data from authority sources to show the magnitude of the problem, and to answer "what's in it for you". Most grantmakers are looking for contribution, so I showed them the huge impact this project was going to have in real families with real faces.
[p]Dan Lok Your mentorship keeps saving lives. You have no idea the ripple effect of your work, on millions of lives around the globe... many of which don't even know you.
[p]Thanks Sifu .This is one of those moments that make ALL the learning and effort in learning the copywriting skill worth it.
