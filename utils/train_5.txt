[p]of a transformation.
[p]You want to also turn that problem in your life for good.
[span]Pay your rent
[p].
[span]Pay your debt.
[p]How do you do all that with a meager salary, or in fact, no job?
[p]I didn’t start this story well. From 2017.
[p]A fresh 16-year-old secondary school graduate
[strong]started working in the
[p]market where they sell Agrochemicals from
[span]9 am-7 pm daily
[p]for a
[span]15k salary and 500 daily stipends.
[p]My mother was a cleaner.
[p]My dad was a technician who has tried many other things from a Photo production company (beautiful days) to a taxi driver (harsh days).
[p]Same
[strong]2021,
[p]I started
[span]affiliate marketing,
[p]my first online business.
[p]But it is not affiliate marketing that did what you saw up there.
[p]Affiliate marketing opened me up to this
[strong]business model
[p]where all they do is
[span]package information on different topics in the form of books.
[p]But it wasn’t easy with the family issues at home.
[span]Sapa wan kill me inside the online business, I almost quit. Thank God I didn’t.
[p]Not only was I able to make I life out of my online businesses, but I was also able to teach over 23,000 people how they can do this themselves.
[p]Why am I telling you all these stories?
[p]It’s possible you didn’t know Amazon paid
[strong]$522,000,000
[p]in
[strong]2022
[p]to people like me;
[span]$450 million in 2021.
[p]That’s around
[span]520 BILLION
[p]naira in one year!
[p]Why can’t you be a part of this?
[strong]You don’t know how it works?
[p]I will show you.
[strong]You are shy?
[p]You don’t have to speak to people.
[strong]You don’t have a laptop?
[p]Your Android phone can do the job.
[strong]You are a student?
[p]As of 2023, I am in my final year. I singlehandedly built my family house.
[strong]What was that excuse you were making up for yourself and your family again?
[p]I haven’t told you about the business in detail because I wanted to make
[span]sure you were ready to not waste my time and yours.
[p]Since you have read this part, I can go ahead to tell you about the business.
[span]It is AMAZON KDP
[strong]I know, you might have heard about it a lot.
[p]And if true, you must have heard about me.
[p]Some consider me the
[strong]NO. 1 in Nigeria,
[p]but I don’t believe it to be so.
[p]Just that, I have been able to make a lot of people millionaires using tested and proven strategies detailed in the
[span]STELLAR PUBLISHING GUIDE.
[p]Before I go deeper,
[span]what is Amazon KDP?
[strong]AMAZON KDP
[span](fully, Amazon Kindle Direct Publishing)
[p]is a self-publishing platform owned by one of the World’s richest men Jeff Bezos.
[p]It is part of his
[span]E-commerce Company, Amazon.
[p]It is called
[span]Self-publishing because
[p]– unlike normal publishing – it is done by the Authors themselves
[strong]FOR FREE.
[p]You
[strong]don’t have to pay Amazon
[p]to publish your book either as an eBook or paperback, even hardcover.
[p]All you do is
[span]Upload your book, set the price, and Amazon displays your book to its Millions of audiences.
[p]why would Amazon do it for
[strong]free?
[span]How does Amazon earn from it?
[p]Simple. As your book sells, you give Amazon 30% of every copy of eBook sold, and 40% of paperback sold minus printing cost.
[p]So, let’s say your ebook sells for
[strong]$6.99.
[p]If you make 1 sale, Amazon
[span]takes 30% and you get $4.89.
[p]Imagine you sell
[strong]100 copies
[p]of that 1 book in a month…
[span]HOW MUCH?
[strong]Do you think it’s hard to make 100 sales a month?
[p]Well, here is Kingsley with
[span]100 sales in one day!
[p]Convert to naira at the rate of
[span]1000 naira/dollar.
[p]That is

[span]No Experience Required

[span]No Sales Calls or Chats. No referral.
[strong]Amazon is great for Self-publishers.
[p]And this does not mean Authors or writers alone.
[p]Even non-writers make a good sum of money monthly.
[p]Just pay attention to all I am unveiling.
[p]I love
[span]Amazon KDP as a non-writer than writer.
[p]I am a poet, and I have been published in many online magazines.
[p]Just type
[strong]“Aiyejinna Abraham”
[p]on Google and you’ll see proofs.
[p]But I don’t sell my poem collections on Amazon or the books I write. Why?
[p]If you go as a writer on Amazon,
[span]YOU CAN still sell.
[p]Just that I know many “writers” struggling to earn on the same Amazon because they think Amazon is just about putting your book out, but the STELLAR publishing guide will open your eyes to how
[span]Amazon KDP works.
[p]At this point,
[span]if you are strongly in the pursuit of fame
[p]that results from being a published author, I will kindly advise that you stop reading; I am of less help to you.
[p]I know what I am saying.
[strong]BUT if you are tired of being broke.
[p]If you want to start feeding yourself and your family. If you want to stop being a disturbance to friends, uncles, boyfriends etc, LISTEN to me.
[p]I am not saying you can’t publish your books, or that you shouldn’t.
[p]In fact, with the knowledge you will get, you can publish your own books.
[p]But I want you to treat this as a business. Eat first, my friend.

[p]I remember when I first found out that I could earn money online, I was skeptical.
[strong]"Will this work?"
[p]"
[span]Is this not another Ponzi scheme?"
[p]But the lack I was facing then was enough pain already.
[span]Work from 9 am-7 pm carrying chemicals weighing 24kg upwards.
[p]I started developing muscles. I became dark and thin, and I was always tired.
[p]God knew I was only doing that
[strong]to have cash.
[p]Daily, I lamented about how the mornings come fast.
[p]The worst part, is when the time comes for school, I find out that I s
[strong]aved nothing,
[p]and I begin to scratch everywhere for funds to resume.
[span]It was horrible.
[p]I worked for 4 weeks with the hope of getting something to resume with but looking at resumption with dismay. Don't ask if I have parents.
[p]I do. And I also have 4 siblings. I am the first, I can't leave my responsibility to my parents anymore, they still have 4 to handle.
[p]Maximum of 2 weeks, I always called Dad in school for one money or the other.
[span]1500, 2000, and 3000
[p]will come, and before I get 4 handouts and Detergents,
[span]I'm broke again.
[p]I started taking pictures of handouts. I turned a 75-page statistic handout into pdf
[p]. It was stressful but I had to do it to catch up educationally. I even deserted my first SIM because I owed MTN 1500.
[strong]Life wasn't easy.
[p]I applied for different scholarships in my UG1, with
[span]a GPA of 4.8 out of 5
[p]. I wasn't even called for screening exams until I got to my final year.
[p]I wanted to help. Honestly, I wanted to. But life wasn't ready for my cries, but action. In 2021, I took a new course of life.
[p]Invested in myself by getting a guide from borrowing from 2 sources.
[p]I toiled hard to ensure I pay back. Due to the frustration,
[span]I wasn't patient to learn;
[p]I rushed everything.
[p]And to my greatest hit, I couldn't meet up my deadline for payment. I dodged my borrower since I was in school. But I kept working.
[p]During my 200L second semester break, I stayed back at school. That time, I took my time to stay patient with learning.
[span]Today?
[p]I pay my school fees. And that of others.
[p]I built a house for my family.
[p]I bought a new Samsung Galaxy of almost 714,500 to carry on my KDP business. (I was using techno of 22k before).
[p]I have 2 laptops (Lenovo & a MacBook 2022 Pro).
[p]I now send money to my parents.
[p]I can get what I want when I want.
[p]I am more confident about my future.
[p]Don't think I have 2 heads, I don't.
[span]You can do it too.
[p]You can literally take your life from 4-figures to 6, 7-figures, not in a day or week, oh,
[strong]but that’s why we call it growth.
[p]I don't like giving
[span]fake promises.

[strong]But let’s assume you fail.
[p]Yes, that you start this journey, and nothing comes out of it while you are consistent. That will be terrible for me too.
[p]But how did I get over
[strong]22,000 people
[p]to trust and  learn from me?
[span]Please, this is not an investment scheme.
[p]You are not putting money into returns.
[p]You are enrolling in an academy where you will be taught the rudiments of a successful Amazon KDP business.
[strong]There is no Refund.
