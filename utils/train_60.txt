[b]Selling
[b]Secrets ANYONE Can Use To
[a]SELL MORE OF THEIR PRODUCTS, PROGRAMS, OR SERVICES…
[a]“BUT FIRST…
[b]What Is a Table Rush?”
[div]Have you ever witnessed a
[b]stampede of buyers RACE to the back of the room
[div], order form in hand,
[b]practically begging to purchase the product
[div]they just learned about?
[a]THAT WOULD BE A
[b]“table rush”.
[b]I want to show you how to inspire your audience to jump out of their seat, reach their back pockets to take out their credit cards, and invest in what you have to offer…
[span]because the same principles apply both online and offline.
[b]This is a highly specialized skill that
[a]TRULY DIFFERENTIATES TO THE TOP 0.1% OF MARKETERS
[b]with everyone else.
[div]To be clear,
[b]this event is not about speaking or presenting confidently.
[div]You can properly learn how to do that for free in Toastmasters.
[b]There is a huge difference between public speaking and actually closing and converting your audience into paying customers.
[a]THESE STRATEGIES WORK FOR HIGH TICKET OFFERS AS WELL…
[b]keep reading to see how it works.
[b]from: peng joon
[span]I can still recall how it all began…
[b]In March 2012, I received a life changing phone call from Success Resources. They were the largest seminar company in the world.
[div]For many years I have been marketing online and
[b]I thought doing a presentation was pretty much the same thing.
[div]I thought to myself "
[b]As long as I provide great content and value
[div], the audience will be able to make that informed decision and invest in what it is that I have to offer."
[b]Pretty straightforward, right?
[div]When it was time to make the offer, and
[b]I asked them to go to the back tables to invest, nobody moved.
[b]i bombed... hard.
[b]it was weird. it was awkward. it was embarrasing.
[span]It was in this huge expo hall with 900 people and back then things were very different. There was no music, nothing.
[div]I had to walk to the back of the room and it was like the walk of shame.
[b]That walk felt like it took forever.
[b]The funny thing was... I had so many people coming up to me after, telling me how great the content was and how inspired they were but nobody bought anything!
[div]That was when I realized that
[b]speaking and selling are 2 completely different skills.
[div]As I continued the journey of practicing and learning from the best of the best, I got better.
[b]From totally sucking initially, I sucked less and less. And eventually, I realized hey... I'm pretty good at this!
[b]Now,
[a]AFTER YEARS OF PRACTICING… YEARS OF SPEAKING ON HUNDREDS OF STAGES
[b], I’VE DISCOVERED SOME OF THE
[i]MOST EFFECTIVE,
[b]AND LITTLE-KNOWN STRATEGIES TO MAKE
[a]MILLION-DOLLAR PRESENTATIONS.
[div]If there's one thing I've learned in this journey, is that
[b]speaking and closing (both online and offline) is a learnable, trainable skill.
[div]If you've ever wanted to discover how to present in a way that's unforgettable, have your audience hanging on your every word, and have them invest in whatever it is that you have to offer at the end, then this LIVE event is for you.
[b]This event will reveal the same strategies that have generated me well over $25MM++ through sales videos, webinars, and live events...
[div]and how you can do it too.
[a]"THIS IS NOT THEORY...
[b]I've Used These Strategies in Over 20+ Countries..."
[b]I’ve Mastered The Lost Art Of
[a]“ONE-TO-MANY” SELLING...
[div]I’m actually really horrible when it comes to selling one on one.
[b]But, because I’m able to speak to 100 people…
[b]Or 1,000 people…
[b]Or 10,000 people all at once online, with ONE presentation…
[div]And, because I know how to craft and structure my presentation…
[b]I’m able to make MORE money in a fraction of the time!
[div]When you are selling face-to-face, you have the unique ability to ask specific questions, get their personal feedback, and resolve their objections on-the-spot... right?
[div]When you’re in a room (or virtual room) you can’t really ask questions and get answers from THOUSANDS of people…
[div]... so you need to create your presentation in a way that resolves all of their objections for as many people as possible.
[b]Once You Master That, You’ve Mastered
[a]THE ART OF MASS SELLING!
[div]How would you like me to show you
[b]EVERYTHING you need to do to create your very own presentation
[div]that creates a table rush in YOUR business, plus give you ALL the tools you need (already done)… without paying me $50,000 to walk you through everything?
[b]But Don’t Just Take My Word For It…
[a]HERE’S WHAT OTHERS HAVE TO SAY
[div]“If you’re looking to do events, drive traffic, sell products, I highly recommend working with Peng Joon”
[b]– Russell Brunson
[div]“Not only myself but I had my director of events go through Peng Joon’s system. I don’t recommend a lot of people but this system, I highly recommend.”
[b]– Dan Lok
[div]“As a direct result of learning with Peng Joon, I actually created my own online training program, The Iron Mastery and the results was overwhelming! Take it from me, he will definitely change your life.”
[b]– Jordan Yeoh
[div]“I was able to crank out a brand new webinar, start to finish, in one night. He made it so easy in a done-for-you way to follow… he gives you actual templates to follow and a video that you play and pause as you go with each slide. I was able to double my close rate in the last webinar I did with his strategy which is huge because I’ve been doing webinars for years. If you’re on the fence, the answer is YES!”
[b]– Molly Kaiser
[b]“That’s Why We Created Table Rush Secrets LIVE”!

[b]These Are The Simple
[a]“TABLE RUSH SECRETS”
[b]I Use In My Presentations to
[a]GENERATE MORE SALES IN 90 MINUTES
[b]Than What Some CEOs Make In a Year…
[div]And This Script Is The SAME Script We Use For Our Webinars, Facebook Lives, And Sales Videos To Grow Our Companies At Record Rates…
[a]YOU MIGHT BE THINKING:
[b]“But Peng Joon, I Don’t Speak On Stage… What Does All Of This Has To Do With ME!?”
[b]everything.
[b]everything.
[b]Pay close attention to this next part…
[div]While it's true that the reality is that most people will never speak in these large stages,
[b]the same techniques when it comes to influence, sales, persuasion, and closing
[div]still applies whether you want to do it on…
[b]LIVE or Automated Webinars...
[b]5 Minute Sales Videos...
[b]Selling on Facebook LIVE...
[a]WE HAVE CLIENTS IN EVERY MARKET AND NICHE
[b]who are using this SAME framework in their own businesses!
[b]They use it to sell EVERYTHING you can dream of, like:
[b]Investing...
[b]Pet Supplies...
[b]​Network Marketing…
[b]​Gym Owners…
[b]​Chiropractors...
[b]​Coaching/Consulting...
[b]​Dental...
[b]​Sports/Fitness Training...

[b]HERE’S WHAT OTHERS HAVE TO SAY
[b]HERE’S WHAT OTHERS HAVE TO SAY
[div]“I thought I knew about how to throw and monetise live events, but apparently not! I know that I will be able to double our conversions just from what I discovered from Peng Joon.”
[b]- Alex Dee
[div]“I followed Peng Joon's process and executed on it, and even though it was my first time doing a live event, we did over $400,000 in sales!”
[b]- Sterling Griffin
[div]“In just one coaching call with Peng Joon, I went on to sell tickets in a live event, and did $92,000 in sales. Needless to say, I want to encourage you, you're listening to the right guy.”
[b]- Eileen Wilder
[div]“My mind is blown. I learned so much at this event on how to create more sales. I am so glad I attended. Make sure you implement what it is that Peng Joon teaches.”
[b]– Myron Golden
[div]“Peng Joon just changed my life. I didn’t know how to and where to start and I’m walking away with more confidence than ever before.”
[b]- Alison Prince
[b]Now, one of my fears whenever people see these pictures of me being on stage is this.
[b]“But Peng Joon…
[a]I’VE GOT NO INTENTIONS TO BE A SPEAKER OR TO BE ON STAGE…”
[b]If you have never set foot on a stage before, that’s 100% ok…
[div](because you can STILL earn more money speaking than other highly-paid speakers!)
[b]think about it...
[b]Every single day, you’re on some sort of a platform... right?
[b]Sometimes your platform will be having a
[a]conversation face-to-face…
[b]Sometimes that platform is
[a]negotiating with someone in a meeting…
[b]​Or a podcast...
[b]​Or Instagram...
[b]​Or YouTube...
[b]​Or over the phone...
[b]​Or on a FB LIVE...
[b]​Or a podcast...
[b]​Or Instagram...
[b]​Or YouTube...
[b]​Or over the phone...
[b]​Or on a FB LIVE...
[b]This script I’m going to teach you
[a]WORKS IN ANY BUSINESS...
[b]This process works over and over and over again,
[b]No matter what market or niche you're in...
[b]​No matter if you're selling from the stage, or a webinar, or on FB LIVE!
[b]No matter if you’re shy or introverted like I am
[b]… Even if nobody knows who you are right now!

[b]“But Peng Joon…
[a]I DON’T LIKE TO SPEAK OR SELL.
[b]I Don’t Want To Be On Webinars Or Facebook Lives…
[a]I JUST WANT TO GROW MY BUSINESS!
[b]”
[div]If this is how you feel, then don’t worry. I know EXACTLY where you’re coming from.
[b]When I first started my business, I never wanted to be doing “this”.
[span]This being on stages, on webinars or to be in the limelight.
[div]I just wanted to be behind the scenes and working on my business.
[b]I was that shy, introverted, awkward kid….
[b]I didn’t want to speak!
[b]Back in 2009, I attended a personal development event from Tony Robbins.
[div]This was during a time when I was anonymous online, just marketing products in the gaming market.
[div]But what happened at the end changed my perspective on how marketing can and should work.
[div]At the end of his presentation, I still remember what happened...
[b]He asked the audience if he could make a special offer.
[div]I was as excited as everyone else to see what this offer might be.
[div]After everyone agreed, he made a special offer for his $15,000 offer.
[b]And what happened next changed my life.
[b]I remember watching people not just walking, but SPRINTING to the back of the room to buy his offer! (including ME!)
[div]Now, if you made the full investment for this offer, you get to go on stage to take this group picture with Tony.
[div]I remember looking around me at everyone else that was on stage and in
[b]my head starting to tally up how much sales was generated in the last 15 minutes…
[b]$15,000…
[b]$30,000…
[b]$45,000…
[b]I Realized That He Made Over
[a]$585,000 IN THAT 90 MINUTES…
[b]… and this amount didn’t include instalment plans, or deposits or partial payments.
[div]When everything was said and done, there was probably over $1,000,000 in sales generated…
[a]I asked myself, how many ways can an entrepreneur make over $1MM in 90 minutes?
[b]You could…
[b]List a company
[b]Win the lottery
[b]Rob a bank?!?
[b]… or learn this skill set!
[div]On top of all of the sales generated, Tony had the lives of thousands changed and transformed that day.
[div]That was when I knew I HAD to learn this skill.
[b]I didn’t really want to be a stage presenter…
[b]But I knew that if someone who was JUST LIKE ME, could step on stage and in an HOUR make more money then I had made in a year…
[b]...then I NEEDED to learn that skill,
[b]At WHATEVER COST.
[b]...THEN I NEEDED TO LEARN THAT SKILL, AT WHATEVER COST.
[b]Maybe I wasn’t going to earn $1,000,000 like Tony,
[div](or so I thought at the time)...
[b]But what if this one skill could help make an extra $100,000 per year?
[b]What would it be worth to learn THAT skill…?
[b]HERE’S WHAT OTHERS HAVE TO SAY...
[div]“Peng Joon gave me these super insightful strategies that I’ve never heard anyone teaching… and I’m completely immersed in the world of internet marketing, business development, and Peng’s event was absolutely one of the best events I’ve ever attended.”
[b]– James Friel
[div]“I thought I knew a lot about events… until I came to this one. Peng Joon completely over-delivered and inspired me to bring my A-game even higher than before.”
[b]– Natasha Hazlett
[b]Now, you’re probably wondering…
[b]“How Much Will It Cost To Have Me, Train You And Your Family For 3 Days…?”
[b]Normally if you were to attend any of our LIVE events, it is $3,997 per person.
[div](That means, to bring a family of 4 - like mine - it would cost $16,000!)
[div]Oh, and you have flights… hotels… and food costs.
[b]But, since we’re going to be streaming it LIVE into your home, or to your phone…

[b]Who is the Table Rush Secrets LIVE for?
[b]This event is for business owners, entrepreneurs, and marketers
[div]who want to learn
[b]how to successfully sell products, programs, and services.
[div]Regardless of whether you sell digital, physical, or services, the event will walk you through the exact strategies that I’ve personally used online or offline…
[b]"But what if I'm not a speaker? What if I've never made a single speech ever?"
[div]As I mentioned before,
[b]I wasn’t a speaker either. I was shy, and introverted. (I still am)
[div]…
[b]but I knew I needed that skill!
[div]I’ve gone through all of those hard-lessons and learning curves for you, so you don’t have to.
[b]"So I don't have to speak on stage?"
[div]You can become a top-paid speaker without making ONE speech from the stage! Speaking on stage is just one way but you can
[b]utilise these strategies on other platforms like webinars, 1-1 sales, auto-webinars, Facebook, sales videos, and meetings.
[b]"Can I really make good money as a new speaker, even if I'm not famous, and nobody knows me?"
[b]Absolutely.
[div]Most of the time if I’m running ads, it’s being marketed to people who don’t know me. If I’m speaking on the stage, a large majority would only be
[b]hearing of me for the first time
[div]. People don’t buy because you’re famous. People will invest in your offer when it’s shown at the
[b]right time
[div], to the
[b]right audience
[div]with the
[b]right message
[div]… and that’s what this event is about.
