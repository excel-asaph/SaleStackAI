[div]“How Would You Like To Attend Our 3-DAY VIRTUAL Conference
[h2]And
[b]Only Pay
[u]After
[h2]The Conference
[u]IF
[h2]You Feel Like It Was Worth It?!?”
[b]From:
[span]Russell Brunson
[b]Where:
[span]Boise, Idaho
[span]Hey everybody...
[span]We've decided to do it again!
[span]Yes, earlier this year we did our first EVER virtual conference called:
[font]We had over 5,000 people register for this online event,
[div]and the
[b]success stories
[div]from those who attended have been amazing...
[span]They loved the
[b]strategies
[span]...
[span]The
[b]connections
[span]they made…
[span]The
[b]powerful stories
[span]that were shared from other Funnel Hackers…
[span]And the
[b]motivational BOOST
[span]to secure and scale their business!
[b]But SOMETHING happened afterward that we
[i]didn’t
[b]plan on…
[span]Everyone loved it SO much, that we’ve been constantly getting hounded with the same question…
[font]“When Can We Do This Conference AGAIN?”
[b]From:
[span]Russell Brunson
[b]Where:
[span]Boise, Idaho
[div]At this
[b]last Funnel Hacking LIVE
[div]we did things differently...
[div]Instead of
[u]speakers sharing various marketing strategies
[div]...
[b]we focused everything on ONE thing: ‘The Linchpin’.
[div]People went bananas...
[b]Why?
[div]Because they got to see first-hand,
[u]how ‘The Linchpin’ works
[div]to bring in
[b]BOATLOADS
[div]of paying members into any continuity membership regardless of business or economy...
[div]They also got to witness how ‘The Linchpin’
[u]took ClickFunnels from a start-up in a tiny office with just 3 members
[div]...
[b]to becoming a 9-figure /yr business in just 3 short years!
[div]After the event, people were begging for encore... but I said no...
[div]I said we can do EVEN BETTER.
[div]So instead of a regular encore, I hand-picked
[b]THE quintessential presentations
[div]that can teach you about ‘The Linchpin’, show you
[b]step-by-step
[div]how it works...
[div]...including real-world examples from entrepreneurs
[b]who are currently using ‘The Linchpin’
[div]in
[u]their business with incredible success
[div]!
[div]After FHL, I wasn’t expecting the
[u]overwhelming number of people reaching out
[div], thanking me for showing them
[b]‘The Linchpin’
[div]and how to use it to build profitable continuity memberships for their own businesses.
[div]That’s when I realized I hit a serious “pain point.”
[div]See, right now... more than ever... businesses are struggling to get and then
[b]KEEP
[div]customers.
[div]Sooooooo many customers are coming in through the front door and out the back faster than your
[b]“welcome email” gets clicked open.
[div]You can’t
[u]build a thriving continuity membership program
[div]if you can’t build upon your customer base month after month.
[b]‘The Linchpin’ SOLVES this problem.
[b]If You Want Long-Term, Sustainable Business...
[div]The Linchpin Model Is The Way
[div]If you want to outspend your competitors and acquire more customers,
[b]The Linchpin Model is THE BEST, most effective marketing system that works for any business.
[b]The Linchpin model
[div]revolutionizes normal, “stale” funnels and gives you a multi-dimensional, geometrically advanced way to run your business.
[div]And I want to give you the
[b]BEST step-by-step
[div]presentations from the top entrepreneurs who are using ‘The Linchpin’ model in their own business...
[u]so you can get your....
[div]FIRST 1,000 paying members to your membership site FAST!
[b]Name of The Game in 2024:
[div]The Power Of Continuity For Recurring Revenue
[b]That’s where ‘The Linchpin’ shines...
[div]When you implement
[b]‘The Linchpin’
[div]—and in the correct way we’ll be showing you in the
[b]Two Comma Club LIVE conference
[div]—you have the potential of writing your own checks.
[div]You can finally say goodbye to “hustling” yourself to death to maintain customer numbers... or having to churn client after client every month.
[b]After you implement ‘The Linchpin’ in your marketing for 2024...
[li]You’ll
[b]finally have a real working “continuity offer”
[li]where sales compound month after month... and have it work regardless of economic shifts.
[li]You’ll
[b]finally break out of the “hamster wheel”
[li]of churning out client after client
[li]You’ll
[b]finally have a business on YOUR terms,
[li]giving you the freedom, time, and income you deserve!
[li]​
[u]You’ll
[b]finally have a marketing system that attracts your first 1,000 paying members
[u]that become die-hard fans of you!
[div]In short — If you want to outspend your competitors and acquire more customers,
[b]The Linchpin Model is THE BEST, most effective marketing system that works for any business.
[div]The
[b]Linchpin model revolutionizes
[div]normal, “stale” funnels and gives you a multi-dimensional, geometrically advanced way to run your business!
[div]Now, the most difficult milestone Tends to be
[u]the first “1,000”
[div]...
[b]First
[u]1,000
[b]calories burned...
[b]First
[u]1,000
[b]words written...
[b]First
[u]1,000
[b]dollars made online...
[div]It’s hard because that number can feel daunting, especially if you don’t know what that first “1,000” feels like.
[div]But picture this...
[div]Imagine you brought in your first
[b]1,000 people paying you $47 /mo
[div]into your membership program...
[div]How would your life be different if you had 1,000 people paying you $47 every month...?
[div]How about
[b]$100 a month...?
[div]What would you do if you had
[b]1,000 people paying you $497 a month...?
[span]Think you would be able to pay off debts faster...?
[div]Maybe say
[b]“sayanora” to the ol’ clock-in, clock-out daily grind..
[div]?
[div]Or, what if you could finally take that trip you’ve been promising your spouse or family...
[div]I want to do something special that I promise can help blow past the
[b]“1,000 difficulty”
[div]belief...
[div]...by giving you my most coveted secret that’s like attaching “rocket boosters” to your marketing, helping you get your first

[b]Create Your Membership Site
[div]It’s true — continuity is King. Why? Because continuity allows for predictable, sustainable business growth month after month without having to worry about re-fill your customer pool. However...

[div]Then, you’ll learn how

[div]But... how do you do that? What’s the “science” behind a “MIFGE” offer? And what’s the
[b]difference between
[div]a “MIFGE” offer that tanks... and one that can transform your business practically overnight...?
[b]I (Russell) will throw back the curtain
[div]and show you what a “MIFGE” offer looks like, how to make it irresistible,
[u]and how you can build your very own “MIFGE” offer for an avalanche of your golden customers.

[div]knowing you run a successful membership with 1,000 members each paying you $197 a month, and doing it all from the cozy comfort of your own home.
[b]I’m not saying it WILL happen to you. (Mabe the “cozy comfort” part...)

[b]We wanted to do something special.
[div]Normally if you were to attend any of our

[div]Then do NOTHING, and we’ll bill you the $197 AFTER it’s over.
[b]If for some reason you decide that the Conference isn’t for you
[b]then on the last day, I’ll give you a special email address, that you can email and let me know that you didn’t think it was worth the $197…
[span]If so, then we’ll cancel your order, and you will never pay anything.
[b]Does that sound fair?

[b]Would you pay $197 to learn the secrets of what “The Crazy 1%”

[div]If you could grab and implement just a handful of principles they are using inside their business...would it be worth it?
[div]Can you even imagine the
[b]golden nuggets
[div]that they’ve already struggled with, learned the ‘hard way’, and are going to teach you (so you can have a major short-cut)?
