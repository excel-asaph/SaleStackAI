[b]Here’s a harsh reality about business that no coach, ‘guru’, or anybody that’s got something to sell will reveal…
[div]90% of ALL businesses fail in the first three years because of ONE thing.
[b]That's NOT:
[b]Oh, just take a break from it for a bit and come back stronger...
[b]Don’t worry, it’s just a phase you’re going through that’ll pass…
[b]Things are a little tight, sure, but you’ll bounce back…
[b]​Hang in there, you’re very close to figuring it all out…
[b]No.
[b]That's:
[b]“You’re 90 days delinquent on your loan, we’re coming after your house”…
[b]Don’t worry, it’s just a phase you’re going through that’ll pass…
[b]“Guys, we aren’t going to make payroll this week, don’t try to cash your check”…
[b]​“Another NSF notice just hit, let’s start cancelling the autopays and selling equipment”…
[b]​“I’m so sorry, but we just aren’t making it and I have to let you go”…
[b]​“Honey, I need to talk to you. I don’t think this dream is going to happen”…

[b]In fact, there’s never been a more perfect time in history to completely fail-proof your business.

[b]Here’s what they don’t tell us in business school… and that those ‘coaches’ out there have no clue about.
[b]If your business isn’t growing…
[b]… it’s dying.
[div]Even further,
[b]in order to grow… you MUST scale.
[div]Growing without scaling is like trying to grow an 80-foot oak tree inside a clay pot in your living room.
[div]Sure, you can start there and grow it for a few months…
[div]… but what happens once it’s roots start shooting through the pot?
[div]Or it’s limbs start pushing against your wall?
[div]It’s setting up for failure.
[div]There’s no way around it, and nobody’s immune to it.

[b]There’s something that you probably didn’t think about this way, that’ll all make sense soon.

[div]It’s okay to be feeling a few things right now.
[b]Worried.
[b]Anxious.
[b]Sceptical.
[b]Unsure.
[div]That’s all just fine, don’t worry.
[div]Just, don’t stop reading. That’s the worst thing you could do right now.
[div]You’ve already found out that this whole entrepreneur thing has come with a LOT more stress, anxiety, and hassle than what you signed up for, right?

[b]Well, think about this for a second.
[div]Are the problems YOU face the types of problems of an exploding business… experiencing “growing pains”?
[div]Like, GOOD problems? (i.e. “crap, we can’t handle any more orders…uh oh, we need to hire more help to service all these clients…oh boy, we’ve got $200,000 cash in the bank that is about to get taxed, what do we do with it?”...etc.)
[div]… or, if you can be honest with yourself for a second, are they the types of problems of a business that’s fighting, clawing, and scratching it’s way through the day-to-day “hustle”?

[div]I’ll hit you with a quick reality check:
[div]Makes sense, right?
[b]But, the only problem?
[div]Scaling it is NOT as simple as folks out there make you want to think.
[div]In fact, I compare it to tending to a very delicate plant.
[div]Too much water…
[div]Too little water…
[div]Too much sun…
[div]Too little sun…
[div]… and what happens?
[div]It’s gone.
[b]No going back.
[b]No do-overs.
[b]It has to be done properly, or it WILL end badly.

[b]Not a chance.
[b]Why?
[div]Almost nobody does this the right way.
[div]… and the ones that are, are busy DOING IT in their business.
[div]Not selling cheap coaching or putting up free YouTube videos about it.

[b]When people think about scaling, they typically think these 4 thoughts:
[li]“Scaling is really hard and will take years to fully implement in my business”
[li]“I am going to need to create systems and SOP’s which will take forever”
[li]“I’m going to need a giant team of people that will be difficult to hire and manage”
[li]​“I need to fix a bunch of stuff before I’m ready to scale the right way”

[li]I want to have a 6, 7, or 8-figure business, but I’m afraid I’ll end up working more or I’ll end up less happy than with what I’m doing now
[li]​I know I’m working too much right now and need to get out of my business, but have tried in the past and it just doesn’t work for me
[li]​I work all day long but feel like I have almost nothing to show for it at the end of the day
[li]​I’ve tried using systems in the past and it just isn’t my thing
[li]​I can’t be both the entrepreneur plus run the operations for my business, it just won’t work

[div]For YEARS…
[b]I dealt with everything you could imagine when it comes to scaling.
[div]I failed more than I care to admit.
[div]Hiring people to have to fire them.
[div]Looking at them in the eye, explaining that I had to let them go… even though they had a family at home depending on that job.
[div]That still haunts me.
[div]… and is what sparked my obsession for scaling.
[div]I vowed to NEVER let one more person down, and that I’d correct this… once and for all.
[div]So I did.
[b]I started out by investing in just about everything I could get my hands on.
[div]Books on growth, scaling, and teams.
[div]Then online programs.
[div]And even some mentors.
[div]I’ll be brutally honest.
[div]When I set out to fix this problem in my own business, I thought I could “outsource” it and let somebody else handle it.
[b]WRONG.

[div]Have you been able to impact 2x, 3x, maybe even 10x the amount of people that you are right now?
[div]Are you able to take off work to spend time with your spouse, kids, or friends?
[div]What does that REALLY look like?

[b]Are you driving a different vehicle, from the extra money you’ve made?
[div]Are you able to go on that trip or getaway with your spouse because your business is making money and running smoothly withOUT you?
[div]Are you getting to spend more quality time at home, hanging out with the ones you love because you don’t feel like you have to be glued to your phone due to the constant demands of your business?
[div]Are you having “hair problems” from the wind whipping over you as you take a victory lap in that sports car you always wanted?
[div]Or… are your toes going numb from the water splashing against your ankles as you walk with your loved one on the beach on that dream vacation?
[div]Or… do your cheeks hurt from laughing your tail off on the couch next to your family as you spend a good hour watching a good movie or TV show, completely stress free?
[div]Is the smell of the campfire taking you back to some cherished childhood memories, which you thought were long gone?
[div]Are you waking up feeling fully rested, having slept like a baby in a perfectly comfortable, luxurious robe at that 5-star resort you’ve only seen in magazines…but are now guests at?
[b]Whatever it is, it’s going to happen… if you visualize it.

[div]… BUT you also have learned your lesson many times with being “too trusting” with a program or coach that promised the moon and back but didn’t fulfil on it… or even trusting yourself to actually set aside the time and focused effort to fix this, once and for all.
[div]Am I right?
[div]Know how I know that?

[b]Worst-case scenario?
[div]You come out to the event and have 53 fires to be put out for leaving for 3 days… which proves why you need to come… and you leave with the empowerment to NEVER deal with the stress of that, ever again.
[div]Not bad, right?

[div]You've spent a LOT of $$ on coaches, courses, training, or everything in between, right??

[div]I'd also bet that you've gotten MORE value from my other stuff than most of the folks you paid, true?? Imagine what'll happen once you actually invest in my ENTIRE system.

[b]what does that REALLY look like for you?
[div]Is your business going to magically become fixed? Are you going to suddenly “figure it all out”? Will you be able to build all this out on your own, by then?
