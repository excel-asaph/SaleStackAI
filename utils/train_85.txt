[h3]A desire to invest in yourself.
[i]"DCA was the biggest investment I had made in my business… and to be honest, I was scared. But the first year of launches made $100K. The second year, $350K. And

[i]"When I bought DCA, I had nothing but an idea.
[b]No tech experience, no email list, no influencer connections.
[i]Now I bring in so much income that
[b]my annual charitable giving is equal to what I used to earn

[h2]"DCA is so step-by-step, it never left me guessing. No stone is left unturned. I knew exactly what to do, so I did it... and it worked! Fast forward 4 years and I’ve generated $1.3 million in course sales."

[p]ANNA ANDERSON
[h2]“I was living paycheck to paycheck, afraid to take the leap — until DCA gave me the roadmap to freedom.”
[p]Lacey Gebo
[h2]“
[h2]What I loved about DCA was that everything — from the beginning to the launch — was broken down into manageable chunks.
[h2]"I pre-sold my course before I had even finished creating it and made $24K. Then, when I officially launched using the DCA framework, I made $61,993! If you follow Amy’s framework, it’s literally fool proof."

[h2]"Amy is one of the clearest, most inspiring teachers you could ever find!
[p]We used her webinar framework to create two webinars for two different programs, both of which were wildly successful.
[b]Her step-by-step process is easy to follow
[p]and customize."
[h2]25,000 Courses Started With Digital Course Academy
[p]Failed launches, business debt, expensive software too confusing to use… a lonely husband, a disappointed stepson, and so much lost sleep.
[p]I desperately needed someone to tell me, “do this, then this, not this.” So with 16 years and $120 million in revenue behind me (and the scars to prove it)… teaching you a
[b]simpler way of doing digital courses
[p]has become my life’s work.
[h3]I thought my greatest desire was to uncomplicate the process for you.
[h2]I found digital course success… but at a cost.
[p]→ Years of medical or student debt erased.
[p]→ A growing, flourishing business and “Founder” proudly written beside your pic.
[p]→ Experiences and opportunities that used to only happen to other people… now just called “Thursdays.”
[p]There's a reason I've developed a reputation for over-delivering… because your wildest dreams have become mine too.
[p]And The Digital Course Academy Experience is my life's work poured into actionable modules to get you there as quickly and easily as possible.
[b]But after teaching 25,000 students, here’s my ultimate goal:
[p]→ Home offices, daily bus stop pickups, lingering chatter over PB&J’s.
