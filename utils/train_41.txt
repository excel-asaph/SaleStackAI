[h2]Here’s How To Make More Money From Your High-Ticket Business Than You’ve Ever Dreamed Of...
[h3]…Without Wasting Ad Spend, Chasing Unqualified Leads, or Getting Stuck on Sales Calls That Go Nowhere
[span]Let’s not play coy.
[span]You got into business to make money. Serious money.
[span]Not just to “cover expenses” or brag about being busy.
[span]You wanted profit. Growth. Freedom.
[span]And maybe—just maybe—
[span]to finally prove you’re as good as you know you are.
[span]So why does it feel like you’re still fighting tooth and nail for every sale?
[span]Why are you spending thousands generating “leads” that:
[span]– don’t book a call,
[span]– ghost when you follow up, or
[span]– show up just to say “I can’t afford it”?
[span]Let me guess…
[span]You’ve tried fixing your sales script.
[span]You’ve tested landing pages.
[span]You’ve even hired “experts” to improve your funnel.
[span]But here’s the uncomfortable truth:
[p]The More You Spend, the Worse It Gets—Unless You Fix This First
[span]Because the
[i]real
[span]problem isn’t downstream. It starts at the source.
[p]The real problem is this…
[h2]Your System Isn't Built To Attract The Right People
[span]That’s why you keep pouring more money into ads that
[span]technically work
[span]… but don’t actually pay off.
[span]You’re not alone.
[span]I’ve worked behind the scenes on funnels and campaigns that have generated millions in high-ticket sales.
[span]From funded startups to solo consultants, the story is always the same:
[span]They didn’t need “more leads.”
[span]They needed better ones.
[h2]Here's What I Mean...
[span]Most people think lead quality is just luck.
[span]That
[span]if you keep running ads
[span], eventually, the right ones will show up.
[span]But that’s not how Meta works.
[span]And it’s definitely not how grown-up businesses scale.
[span]Lead quality is not random. It’s a direct result of:
[span]What you say in your ad
[span]Where you send them
[span]What happens after the click
[span]What data you feed back to the algorithm
[span]If you put the wrong message in front of the wrong audience…
[span]Send them into a generic funnel…
[span]And let Meta optimize for clicks instead of
[span]clients
[span]…
[span]You’ll get “leads,” sure.
[span]Just not the ones that book, buy, or bring referrals.
[span]And here’s the trap:
[span]The more bad leads you get, the more the system thinks that’s what you want.
[span]So it gives you
[span]more of the same
[span].
[span]That’s why your ads slowly decline.
[span]That’s why your close rate drops even when your calls are full.
[span]That’s why you feel like you’re working harder—and earning less.
[span]But when you flip the system, and start feeding it real conversion signals, and filtering traffic through a properly designed funnel…
[span]That’s when everything changes.
[span]Because now, the algorithm is working
[i]for you
[span]—not against you.
[h2]Why This Matters More Than Ever Right Now
[span]Meta doesn’t do interest targeting the way it used to.
[span]Lookalikes? Diminished.
[span]Demographics? Irrelevant if your ad creative is off.
[span]Manual controls? Gone.
[span]The magic bullets of the past, are no longer as effective as they once were
[b]Today,
[u]data
[i]is
[b]the targeting.
[span]The ad platform has shifted from “who do you want to reach?” to “what behavior do you want to scale?”
[span]If you’re unintentionally optimizing for cheap clicks or freebie hunters, that’s what you’ll keep getting—on autopilot.
[span]But when you filter for quality up front…
[span]When you design your funnel like a magnet, not a net…
[span]When you close the loop with real conversion feedback…
[span]You can consistently generate leads that think, act, and buy like your best clients.
[span]I call this
[i]“Data” based Lead Quality Optimization
[i]Introducing…
[h2]MAGNETIC LEADS
[h3]A step-by-step system for attracting high-quality leads that show up ready to buy—so you can finally scale your high-ticket business fast.
[span]This isn’t a collection of random tactics.
[span]It’s a
[b]framework
[span]that fixes the core bottleneck in most high-ticket marketing systems:
[span]the gap between traffic and trust.
[b]Inside, I walk you through exactly how to:
[p] Structure your funnel to attract buyers, not browsers
[p] Use Meta’s algorithm to find the best prospects on autopilot
[p]Filter and pre-frame your leads before they book a call
[p]Track lead quality (not just cost) so you can optimize what matters
[p]Build a system that becomes more accurate, more profitable, and less stressful over time
[p]Whether you’re selling coaching, consulting, real estate, services, or B2B solutions—if your business depends on high-quality conversations with serious buyers…
[p]Magnetic Leads was built for you.
[p]Here’s a summarized…
[h2]Module Breakdown
[div]Module 1: Diagnose Why Your Leads Suck
[p]Find out exactly why you keep attracting people who waste your time, ghost your calls, or can’t afford you.
[li]Uncover the real reason Meta keeps sending you the wrong people—and how to reverse it
[li]Learn the Lead Quality Equation (LQE) to spot hidden funnel problems instantly
[li]See real examples of “good ads, bad pipeline” and how to fix them
[div]Module 2: Positioning That Filters Without Scaring Off Buyers
[p]If your messaging is too “nice,” you’re attracting everyone—including the wrong ones.
[li]→ Write ad and funnel copy that acts like a magnet for $2K+ buyers (and repels the rest).
[li]→ Avoid common positioning mistakes that confuse or invite low-intent prospects.
[li]→ Plug in the Filtering Copy Checklist to upgrade your ads, landing pages, and lead forms instantly.
[div]Module 3: Ad Strategy for High-Intent Clicks
[p]More clicks ≠ better leads. Learn how to run ads that attract buyers—not browsers.
[li]→ Use scroll-stopping frameworks that qualify before they click.
[li]→ Structure creatives that drive urgency, not vanity metrics.
[li]→ Learn the “invisible filter” baked into the best performing ad types (UGC, video, static).
[div]Module 4: Fix Your Funnel Before It Filters You Out
[p]A bad funnel doesn’t just leak money—it blocks your best buyers.
[li]→ Know when to use forms, quizzes, or applications—and how to ask the right questions.
[li]→ Apply quick funnel tweaks that increase your qualified lead % without reducing volume.
[li]→ Pre-frame authority
[em]before
[li]the call so they show up sold, not skeptical.
[div]Module 5: Pre-Sale Filtering & Indoctrination
[p]You don’t need to hard sell—if your follow-up does the sorting for you.
[li]→ What to send after opt-in that doubles your show-up rates and builds belief
[li]→ SMS and email templates that quietly filter out the wrong people
[li]→ Use the Pre-Call Indoctrination Stack™ to make sure buyers arrive ready.
[div]Module 6: Tracking What Actually Matters
[p]If you’re still tracking CPL, you’re blind to what’s really making you money.
[li]→ Shift to CPQL and measure lead quality in real time
[li]→ Use the Lead Quality Score Sheet to benchmark ads, funnels, and follow-up
[li]→ Avoid “attribution panic” with a simple tracking structure anyone can set up
[div]Module 7: Feeding Meta Real Conversion Data
[p]Stop depending on surface-level signals—train the algorithm with what actually converts.
[li]→ Send real revenue events back to Meta using a simple offline conversion setup
[li]→ Supercharge campaign performance without touching targeting
[li]→ Unlock the algorithm’s full power by showing it what “success” really looks like
[h2]So Let’s Talk About the Value (and Why $99 Is Kind of Ridiculous)
[span]If we were pricing this the “industry” way, you’d probably be looking at a
[b]$997 price
[span]tag. Easily.
[span]Why?
[span]Because this isn’t a theory course.
[span]This is a lead quality operating system.
[span]The same one I use with clients who pay me
[i]$9,800+
[span]just to look under the hood of their funnel.
[span]The same system responsible for
[b]multiple 6, 7, and even 8-figure outcomes
[span]across:
[span]Coaching and consulting
[span]Real estate and investing
[span]Health and personal development services
[span]High-ticket education and info products
[span]Photography
[span]Niche B2B lead generation
[span]This is battle-tested, data-backed strategy—not recycled stories from Reddit.
[u]So why $99?
[span]Because I want this to be an
[b]instant yes
[span]for serious business owners who are already spending real money trying to get clients.
[span]You’ve probably lost more than $99 this week alone on bad leads.
[span]You might’ve spent that on one click that didn’t convert.
[span]I’m giving you a system that could change your entire trajectory, for the cost of a dinner and drinks.
[span]Because I’d rather help 1,000 sharp operators like you fix the real problem than sell another overpriced “hack” to people looking for shortcuts.

[span]Get Instant Access
[h2]The Entire System Is Just $99.
[span]Let’s be real—this isn’t a course you “add to your library and forget.”
[span]This is the kind of material people usually pay me crazy figures (That I will rather not share here) to implement inside their business.
[span]But you’re getting it for less than what most advertisers waste on a single bad lead.
[span]Because I want more business owners to stop guessing, stop praying, and start printing.
[span]No
[i]B.S
[span]. No fluff.
[span]Just a proven framework that quietly powers 6, 7, and 8-figure campaigns behind the scenes.
[span]Get Instant Access
[h2]Who This Is For (And Who Shouldn’t Bother)
[span]This course isn’t for everyone.
[span]And that’s intentional.
[span]Because
[span]Magnetic Leads
[span]is built for people who are already in the game—not spectators.
[span]It’s for business owners selling $2K+ offers who know they should be making more, but feel bottlenecked by low-quality leads.
[span]It’s for advertisers spending $1,000+ per month who are tired of wondering why their pipeline feels like a leaky bucket.
[span]It’s for coaches, consultants, agencies, real estate pros, therapists, B2B experts—anyone who closes deals over a conversation, not a “Buy Now” button.
[span]It’s for founders who don’t want to babysit ads, who are willing to build systems, and who value predictable growth over random wins.
[span]If that’s you—you’re going to
[span]love
[span]this.
[b]On the other hand, this is not for you if:
[span]✖️ You’re just starting out and haven’t sold your offer yet
[span]✖️ You’re selling $7 ebooks or impulse buys
[span]✖️ You think Meta ads are magic and don’t want to learn how to
[span]guide
[span]the algorithm
[span]✖️ You’re looking for some plug-and-play “AI funnel in 5 minutes” gimmick

[h2]Why You Need To Act Now (Yes, Now)
[span]Let’s be blunt: Every week you delay this, your business continues to bleed.
[span]You’ll still be:
[span]– Spending money on the wrong traffic
[span]– Talking to people who were never serious buyers
[span]– Wasting hours in follow-ups that go nowhere
[span]– Wondering why your competitors are scaling while you’re stuck
[span]But with
[span]Magnetic Leads
[span], you could be:
[span]Filling your calendar with pre-qualified leads who show up already trusting you
[span]Letting the algorithm
[span]bring you better prospects every week
[span]—with no manual targeting
[span]Confidently scaling ad spend because you know it’s bringing ROI, not just activity
[span]Building a pipeline that pays you back over and over again—with less stress and more control
[span]You’re one decision away from flipping the entire game.
[b]And for $99, it’s hard to justify not doing it.
[span]If you know your offer is strong…

[h2]Why I Built Magnetic Leads (The Real Story)
[span]This system wasn’t created in a vacuum.
[span]It was forged from frustration.
[span]I got tired of watching good businesses with great offers get crushed—not because their service wasn’t solid, but because their lead flow was a mess.
[span]I’ve consulted for 7- and 8-figure brands across real estate, education, SaaS, coaching, and healthcare.
[span]And over and over again, I saw the same thing:
[span]They didn’t need a better ads
[span]They needed a better
[span]system
[span]—one that filtered for quality, guided the algorithm, and grew more accurate over time.
[span]That’s what Magnetic Leads gives you.
[span]I built it to save you thousands in wasted spend, months of confusion, and the silent doubt that creeps in when you’re working hard but not growing fast enough.

[h6]FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
[b]Do I need to be tech-savvy to implement this?
[span]No. If you can follow a Google Doc and use Meta Ads Manager, you’ll be fine. Everything is explained clearly, with templates and visual walkthroughs.
[b]Will this work for [my niche]?
[span]If you’re selling high-ticket offers ($2K+), this system applies. It’s been used in finance, real estate, therapy, coaching, SaaS, and more. The principles are universal. Only the messaging shifts.
[b]What if I don’t have a huge ad budget?
[span]You don’t need one. If you’re spending
[b]at least $1K/month
[span], this course will help you stretch that further. If you’re spending more—this becomes mandatory.
[b]Is this only for people running Meta ads?
[strong]”
[span]The system is designed around Meta’s platform (Facebook & Instagram), but the lead filtering and funnel architecture will help you improve quality across any channel.
[strong]“What kind of results can I expect?”
[p]That depends on what you do with it.
[p]If you watch this course and implement just one piece—like adjusting your ad copy to repel low-quality leads—you might see fewer leads, but more of the
[em]right
[p]ones.
[p]If you use the entire system—ads, filters, funnels, and follow-up—you can expect:
[p]Higher show-up rates
[p]Better conversations
[p]More premium clients
[p]And ads that finally
[em]feel
[p]like they’re working again
[b]Can’t I just figure this out from YouTube?
[span]You could try. But most free content teaches hacks, not systems. And none of it gives you the scorecard, funnel flow, and optimization cadence you’ll get here.
