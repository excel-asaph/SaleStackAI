[div]In Optins, But A
[u]31% DECREASE In Sales
[div]... Can You Guess Which One (and WHY)?
[b](Page 75)
[b]This Test Even Got Jeremy "Shoemoney" Excited!
[div]“On this test, Russell shows you 2 landing pages. One made a 18% increase in conversion rate but DECREASED sales by over 31%. Just by changing one word on the page. I am a huge fan of the psychology that drives people to take an action. Whether its to opt into a newsletter, buy a product, or even what subject line gets the most opens.
[u]But there is a LOT more to it.
[div]Most "guru's" stop there and wow you before they try to sell you something. But what you really need to know is which one actually made sales... Just because someone clicks cause you used a certain color or phrase doesn't mean it leads them to buy. In some cases it even hurts your end goal conversion.
[div]Today though there is a HUGE amount of clutter being put out by so called "experts" that really know crap because they have never had a product.
[div]It's totally bullshit. 99% of them have never sold a real product or ever done anything.
[div]Anyway I will cut to the chase. One of the most accomplished info marketers of our time - Russell Brunson who's sold millions and millions of his OWN products has been a friend of mine for years.
[b]Russell is one of the very few people out there I go to for feedback on our products because he has REAL experience and not talking out of his ass.”

[b]So, What's The Catch...?
[div]I know there are some websites out there that offer you something cool for free, but then stick you into some program that charges your card every month.
[b]This isn't one of them.
[div]There's NO hidden "continuity program" - and in case you're wondering why I'm doing this...
[div]Well, there are actually a few reasons...
[b]1. It's my way of saying thank you
[div]for being a dedicated subscriber.
[b]2.
[span]Because (unlike other "gurus") I don't make all of my money teaching others how to make money (I actually run real businesses online selling software, supplements, physical products and more)...
[b]so because of that, it doesn't hurt me to share with you my best stuff.
[b]3. I get another one of my products in your hands,
[span]and when you see how awesome it is, it should get you excited to buy other stuff from me in the future. The more money I can make you now, the more likely you are to join my $25k Inner Circle program in the future.
[b]4. I'm kinda a show off...
[div]I'm not going to lie. I'm sick of people throwing out conversion numbers and their stats without any real proof to back it up. I think 99% of what is said online is complete BS... so I thought it would be a breath of fresh air to publish the TRUTH, show the actual stats and #'s behind what we do, and well... honestly, I just want you to think I'm cool. :)
